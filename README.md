# Pathfinder

This is Pathfinder, an app that creates career roadmaps using Generative AI. The aim is to provide stepping stones for individuals interested in pursuing certain careers but are unsure how to get there.

During our research, we realized that in many communities, youth and children often do not know what they want to do in life. This is either because they are not aware of the possibilities and opportunities available to them or because they do not have a clear idea of how to pursue their interests. Even those who have an idea of what they want to do often lack guidance on the right path to take. This is often due to a lack of role models in these careers within their communities.

Pathfinder is designed to solve this problem by making it easier for people to discover their interests and providing a smooth pathway to achieving their goals. The app offers step-by-step guidance to help individuals navigate their career journey effectively.
