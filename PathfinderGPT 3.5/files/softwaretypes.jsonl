Accordingly, engineering functions have different types of software engineers in their teams. Some of the most popular types of software engineer roles are:\nFront-End Engineer\nBack-End Engineer\nFull Stack Engineer\nSoftware Engineer in Test (QA Engineer)\nSoftware Development Engineer in Test (SDET)\nDevOps Engineer\nSecurity Engineer\nData Engineer\nCloud Architect\nTable of Contents\nTypes of Software Engineers\n1. Front-End Engineer\n2. Back-End Engineer\n3. Full Stack Engineer\n4. Software Engineer in Test (QA Engineer)\n5. Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)\n6. DevOps Engineer\n7. Security Engineer\n8. Data Engineer\n9. Cloud Architect\n1. Front-End Engineer\nA software engineer who specializes in the development of the user interface (UI) is called a front-end engineer. The user interfaces include visual elements like layouts and aesthetics. Front-end engineers deal with\ncross browser compatibility\nand fixing bugs to ensure an excellent visual presentation of the UI. Thus, they work with the code that runs on different user devices, browsers, and operating systems. Developing a responsive application also comes under this.\nSkills of a Front-End Engineer\nProficiency in\nHTML, CSS,\nand JavaScript\nExperience with front-end frameworks and libraries like\nReact, Angular, Vue.js\n, and jQuery.\nUnderstanding of\nresponsive design\nKnowledge of\nbrowser compatibility issues\nFamiliarity with version control systems\nAbility to work with APIs\nGood communication and collaboration skills\n2. Back-End Engineer\nA software engineer who specializes in the underlying logic and performance of the application is called a back-end engineer. They often design and implement the core logic, keeping in mind scalability. They do this by integrating with data systems, caches, email systems using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\nSkills of a Back-End Engineer\nProficiency in one or more programming languages like Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, or Node.js\nUnderstanding of web development frameworks like Spring, Django, Laravel, or Ruby on Rails.\nExperience with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Cassandra.\nKnowledge of server and network architecture\nFamiliarity with RESTful APIs\nGood debugging and problem-solving skills\nGood communication and collaboration skills\n3. Full Stack Engineer\nA software engineer who can handle both front-end and back-end work is called a full-stack engineer. They have the skills required to create a fully functional web application.\nSkills of a Full-Stack Engineer\nProficiency in one or more programming languages like Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, or Node.js\nExperience with front-end frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js, and jQuery.\nUnderstanding of web development frameworks like Spring, Django, Laravel, or Ruby on Rails.\nFamiliarity with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Cassandra.\nKnowledge of server and network architecture\nAbility to work with APIs\nGood debugging and problem-solving skills\nGood communication and collaboration skills\n4. Software Engineer in Test (QA Engineer)\nA software engineer who is responsible for writing software to validate the quality of the application is called a QA engineer. QA engineers create\ntest plans\n,\nmanual tests\n,\nautomated tests\nusing tools and frameworks to make sure that products and processes run as expected. They create\ntest summary report\n,\nbug reports\n, and take care of\ndefect management\nto ensure that the end user gets a seamless user experience.\nSkills of a Software Engineer in Test (QA Engineer)\nProficiency in one or more programming languages like Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, or Node.js to develop test automation scripts\nUnderstanding of\ndifferent types of testing\nsuch as Unit Testing, Functional Testing, Cross Browser Testing, UI Testing, etc.\nKnowledge of testing frameworks such as JUnit, TestNG, or PyTest to design and execute test cases\nExperience with one or more automation Testing Tools and Libraries such as\nSelenium\n, Appium, Cypress, Playwright, Puppeteer, WebdriverIO,\nNightwatchJS\n, Espresso, XCUITest, Cucumber, etc.\nKnowledge of Tools like\nBrowserStack Live\n,\nApp Live\n,\nAutomate\n,\nApp Automate\n,\nPercy\n,\nApp Percy\n, etc.\nUnderstanding of software development processes such as Agile and Scrum.\nFamiliarity of Databases to create Database Tests\nKnowledge of continuous integration and delivery tools like\nJenkins\n, Bamboo, Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.\nStrong analytical and problem-solving skills\nGood documentation, communication and collaboration skills\nPro-Tip:\nLearn the Skills of Testing with\nBrowserStack’s Test University\nonline.
