Can you envision yourself working in academia? Then you're probably interested in learning how to become a college professor.\nWhat are the basic requirements for becoming a college professor?\nWhat specific steps should you take in order to become one?\nIn this guide, we start with an overview of professors, taking a close look at their salary potential and employment growth rate. We then go over the basic college professor requirements before giving you a step-by-step guide on how to become one.\nFeature Image:\nGeorgia Southern\n/Flickr\nBecoming a College Professor: Salary and Job Outlook\nBefore we dive into our discussion of salaries and employment growth rates, it's important to be aware of the incredible challenge of becoming a college professor.\nThese days, it is unfortunately well known that\nthe number of people qualified to be professors\nfar outnumbers the availability of professor job openings\n, which means that the job market is extremely competitive. Even if you do all the steps below,\nthe chances of your actually becoming a college professor are slim\n—regardless of whether you want to\nteach in the humanities\nor\nsciences\n.\nNow that we've gone over the current status of the professor job market, let's take a look at some hard figures for salary and employment growth rate.\nSalary Potential for Professors\nFirst, what is the salary potential for college professors? The answer to this question depends a lot on\nwhat type of professor you want to be and what school you end up working at\n.\nIn general, though, here's what you can expect to make as a professor. According to\na recent study conducted by the American Association of University Professors\n,\nthe average salaries for college professors are as follows\n:\nFull professors: $140,543\nAssociate professors: $95,828\nAssistant professors: $83,362\nPart-time faculty members: $3,556 per standard course section\nAs you can see,\nthere's a pretty huge range in professors' salaries\n, with full professors typically making $40,000-$50,000 more per year than what associate and assistant professors make.\nFor adjunct professors (i.e., part-time teachers),\npay is especially dismal\n. Many adjunct professors have to\nsupplement their incomes with other jobs\nor even\npublic assistance, such as Medicaid,\njust to make ends meet.\nOne study notes that\nadjuncts make less than minimum wage\nwhen taking into account non-classroom work, including holding office hours and grading papers.\nAll in all, while it's possible to make a six-figure salary as a college professor, this is rare, especially considering that\n73% of college professors are off the tenure track\n.\nEmployment Rates for Professors\nNow, what about employment rates for professor jobs? According to the\nBureau of Labor Statistics\n(BLS),\nthe projected growth rate for postsecondary teachers in the years 2020-2030 is 12%\n—that's 4% higher than the average rate of growth of 8%.\nThat said,\nmost of this employment growth will be in part-time (adjunct) positions\nand not full-time ones. This means that\nmost professor job openings will be those with the lowest salaries and lowest job security\n.\nIn addition, this job growth will vary a lot by field (i.e., what you teach). The chart below shows the median salaries and projected growth rates for a variety of fields for college professors (arranged alphabetically):\nType of Professor\nMedian Salary (2020)\nEmployment Growth Rate (2020-2030)\nAgricultural Sciences\n$90,340\n2%\nAnthropology and Archaeology\n$89,220\n4%\nArchitecture\n$90,880\n5%\nArea, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies\n$78,840\n5%\nArt, Drama, and Music\n$69,690\n6%\nAtmospheric, Earth, Marine, and Space Sciences\n$94,520\n2%\nBiological Science\n$85,600\n9%\nBusiness\n$88,010\n12%\nChemistry\n$80,400\n4%\nCommunications\n$71,030\n3%\nComputer Science\n$85,540\n3%\nCriminal Justice and Law Enforcement\n$63,560\n7%\nEconomics\n$107,260\n5%\nEducation\n$65,440\n5%\nEngineering\n$103,600\n9%\nEnglish Language and Literature\n$69,000\n2%\nEnvironmental Science\n$84,740\n4%\nForeign Language and Literature\n$69,990\n6%\nForestry and Conservation Science\n$87,400\n2%\nGeography\n$82,330\n3%\nHealth Specialties\n$99,090\n21%\nHistory\n$76,890\n4%\nLaw\n$116,430\n7%\nLibrary Science\n$71,580\n3%\nMathematical Science\n$73,650\n1%\nNursing\n$75,470\n18%\nPhilosophy and Religion\n$76,160\n7%\nPhysics\n$90,400\n4%\nPolitical Science\n$85,760\n5%\nPsychology\n$78,180\n9%\nSocial Sciences\n$69,340\n0%\nSocial Work\n$71,570\n6%\nSociology\n$75,610\n4%\nSource:\nBLS.gov\nAs this chart indicates, depending on the field you want to teach in,\nyour projected employment growth rate could range from 0% to as high as 21%\n.\nThe fastest growing college professor field is health; by contrast, the slowest growing fields are social sciences, mathematical science, atmospheric and earth sciences, computer science, and English language and literature. All of these are growing at a slower-than-average pace (less than 5%).\nLaw professors have the highest salary\n, with a median income of $116,430. On the opposite end, the lowest-earning field is\ncriminal justice\nand law enforcement, whose professors make a median salary of $63,560—that's over $50,000 less than what law professors make.\nCollege Professor Requirements and Basic Qualifications\nIn order to become a college professor, you'll need to have some basic qualifications. These can vary slightly among schools and fields, but generally\nyou should expect to need the following qualifications before you can become a college professor\n.\n#1: Doctoral Degree in the Field You Want to Teach In\nMost teaching positions at four-year colleges and universities require applicants to have a doctoral degree in the field they wish to teach in.\nFor example, if you're interested in teaching economics, you'd likely need to get a PhD in economics. Or if you're hoping to teach Japanese literature, you'd get a PhD in a relevant field, such as Japanese studies, Japanese literature, or comparative literature.\nDoctoral programs usually take five to seven years\nand require you to have a bachelor's degree\nand\na master's degree. (Note, however, that many doctoral programs\ndo\nallow you to earn your master's along the way.)\nBut is it possible to teach college-level classes\nwithout\na doctoral degree?\nYes—but only at certain schools and in certain fields.\nAs the BLS notes,\nsome community colleges and technical schools allow people with just a master's degree to teach classes\n; however, these positions can be quite competitive, so if you've only got a master's degree and are up against applicants with doctorates,\nyou'll likely have a lower chance of standing out and getting that job offer\n.\nIn addition, some fields let those with just master's degrees teach classes. For example, for creative writing programs, you'd only need a Master of Fine Arts.\n#2: Teaching Experience\nAnother huge plus for those looking to become professors is teaching experience. This means any experience with leading or instructing classes or students.\nMost college professors gain teaching experience as graduate students.\nIn many master's and doctoral programs, students are encouraged (sometimes even required) to either lead or assist with undergraduate classes.\nAt some colleges, such as the University of Michigan,\ngraduate students can get part-time teaching jobs as\nGraduate Student Instructors (GSIs)\n. For this position, you'll usually teach undergraduate classes under the supervision of a full-time faculty member.\nAnother college-level teaching job is the\nTeaching Assistant or Teacher's Aide (TA)\n. TAs assist the main professor (a full-time faculty member) with various tasks, such as grading papers, preparing materials and assignments, and leading smaller discussion-based classes.\n#3: Professional Certification (Depending on Field)\nDepending on the field you want to teach in, you might have to obtain certification in something in addition to getting a doctoral degree. Here's\nwhat the BLS says\nabout this:\n\"Postsecondary teachers who prepare students for an occupation that requires a license, certification, or registration, may need to have—or they may benefit from having—the same credential. For example, a postsecondary nursing teacher might need a nursing license or a postsecondary education teacher might need a teaching license.\"\nGenerally speaking,\nyou'll only need certification or a license of some sort if you're preparing to teach in a technical or vocational field\n, such as health, education, or accounting.\nMoreover, while you don't usually need any teaching certification to be able to teach at the college level,\nyou\nwill\nneed it if you want to teach at the secondary level\n(i.e., middle school or high school).\n#4: Publications and Prominent Academic Presence\nA high number of publications is vital to landing a job as a professor. Since full-time college-level teaching jobs are extremely competitive,\nit's strongly encouraged (read: basically required!) that\nprospective professors have as many academic publications as possible\n.\nThis is particularly important if you're hoping to secure a tenure-track position, which by far offers the best job security for professors. Indeed, the famous saying \"\npublish or perish\n\" clearly applies to both prospective professors and practicing professors.\nAnd it's not simply that you'll need a few scholarly articles under your belt—\nyou'll also need to have big, well-received publications\n, such as books, if you want to be a competitive candidate for tenure-track teaching positions.\nHere's\nwhat STEM professor Kirstie Ramsey has to say\nabout the importance of publications and research when applying for tenure-track jobs:\n\"Many colleges and universities are going through a transition from a time when research was not that important to a time when it is imperative. If you are at one of these institutions and you were under the impression that a certain amount of research would get you tenure, you should not be surprised if the amount of research you will need increases dramatically before you actually go up for tenure. At first I thought that a couple of peer-reviewed articles would be enough for tenure, especially since I do not teach at a research university and I am in a discipline where many people do not go into academe. However, during my first year on the tenure track at my current institution, I realized that only two articles would not allow me to jump through the tenure hoop.\"\nTo sum up, it's not just a doctorate and teaching experience that make a professor, but also\nlots and\nlots\nof high-quality, groundbreaking research\n.\nHow to Become a Professor: 19-Step Guide\nNow that we've gone over the basic college professor requirements, what specific steps should you take to become one? What do you need to do in high school? In college? In graduate school?\nHere, we introduce to you\nour step-by-step guide on how to become a college professor\n. We've divided the 19 steps into four parts:\nHigh School\nCollege\nGraduate School (Master's Degree)\nGraduate School (Doctorate)\nPart 1: High School\nIt might sound strange to start your path to becoming a professor in high school, but doing so will make the entire process go a lot more smoothly for you. Here are the most important preliminary steps you can take while still in high school.\nStep 1: Keep Up Your Grades\nAlthough all high school students should aim for\nstrong GPAs\n, because you're specifically going into the field of education,\nyou'll need to make sure you're giving a little extra attention to your grades\n. Doing this proves that you're serious about not only your future but also education as a whole—the very field you'll be entering!\nFurthermore, maintaining good grades is important for\ngetting into a good college\n. Attending a good college could, in turn,\nhelp you get into a more prestigious graduate school and obtain a higher-paying teaching job\n.\nIf you already have an idea of what subject you'd like to teach, try to\ntake as many classes in your field as possible\n. For example, if you're a lover of English, you might want to take a few electives in subjects such as journalism or creative writing. Or if you're a science whiz, see whether you can take extra science classes (beyond the required ones) in topics such as marine science, astronomy, or geology.\nAgain,\nbe sure that you're getting high marks in your classes\n, particularly in the ones that are most relevant to the field you want to teach in.\nStep 2: Tutor in Your Spare Time\nOne easy way of gaining teaching experience as a high school student is to become a tutor. Pick a subject you're strong at—ideally, one you might want to eventually teach—and\nconsider offering after-school or weekend tutoring services\nto your peers or other students in lower grades.\nTutoring will not only help you decide whether teaching is a viable career path for you, but it'll also\nlook great on your college applications as an extracurricular activity\n.\nTutoring other students can help you determine whether you enjoy teaching.\n(\nNEC Corporation of America\n/Flickr)\nStep 3: Get a High SAT/ACT Score\nSince you'll need to go to graduate school to become a professor, it'll be helpful if you can get into a great college. To do this,\nyou'll need to have an impressive SAT/ACT score\n.\nIdeally, you'll\ntake your first SAT\nor\nACT\naround the beginning of your junior year. This should give you enough time to take the test again in the spring, and possibly a third time during the summer before or the autumn of your senior year.\nThe SAT/ACT score you'll want to aim for depends heavily on which colleges you apply to.\nFor more tips on how to set a goal score, check out our guides to\nwhat a great SAT\n/\nACT score is\n.\nStep 4: Submit Impressive College Applications\nThough it's great to attend a good college, where you go doesn't actually matter too much—just as long as it offers an academic program in the (broad) field or topic you're thinking of teaching in.\nTo get into the college of your choice, however,\nyou'll still want to focus on putting together a great application\n, which will generally include the following:\nA high GPA and evidence of rigorous coursework\nImpressive SAT/ACT scores\nAn effective personal statement/essay\nStrong letters of recommendation\n(if required)\nBe sure to\ngive yourself plenty of time to work on your applications\nso you can submit the best possible versions of them before\nyour schools' deadlines\n.\nIf you're aiming for the Ivy League or other similarly selective institutions, check out\nour expert guide on how to get into Harvard\n, written by a real Harvard alum.\nPart 2: College\nOnce you get into college, what can you do to help your chances of getting into a good grad school and becoming a college professor? Here are the next steps to take.\nStep 5: Declare a Major in the Field You Want to Teach\nPerhaps the most critical step is to\ndetermine what exactly you want to teach in the future—and then\nmajor in it\n(or a related field)\n. For instance, if after taking some classes in computer science you decide that you really want to teach this subject, then go ahead and declare it as your major.\nIf you're still not sure what field you'll want to teach in,\nyou can always change your major later on or first declare your field of interest as a minor\n(and then change it to a major if you wish). If the field you want to teach is\nnot\noffered as a major or minor at your college, try to take as many relevant classes as possible.\nAlthough it's not always required for graduate school applicants to have majored in the field they wish to study at the master's or doctoral level,\nit's a strong plus\nin that it shows you've had ample experience with the subject and will be able to perform at a high level right off the bat.\nStep 6: Observe Your Professors in Action\nSince you're thinking of becoming a college professor, this is a great time to sit down and observe your professors to help you determine whether teaching at the postsecondary level is something you're truly interested in pursuing.\nIn your classes,\nevaluate how your professors lecture and interact with students\n. What kinds of tools, worksheets, books, and/or technology do they use to effectively engage students? What sort of atmosphere do they create for the class?\nIt's also a good idea to\nlook up your professors' experiences and backgrounds in their fields\n. What kinds of publications do they have to their name? Where did they get their master's and doctoral degrees? Are they tenured or not? How long have they been teaching?\nIf possible,\nI recommend meeting with a professor directly\n(ideally, one who's in the same field you want to teach in) to discuss a career in academia. Most professors will be happy to meet with you during their office hours to talk about your career interests and offer advice.\nDoing all of this will give you an inside look at what the job of professor actually entails and help you decide whether it's something you're passionate about.\nStep 7: Maintain Good Grades\nBecause you'll need to attend graduate school after college, it's important to maintain good grades as an undergraduate, especially in the field you wish to teach. This is necessary because\nmost graduate programs require a minimum 3.0 undergraduate GPA for admission\n.\nGetting good grades also ensures that you'll have a more competitive application for grad school, and indicates that you take your education seriously and are passionate about learning.\nAlways aim high!\nStep 8: Get to Know Your Professors\nAside from watching how your professors teach, it's imperative to\nform strong relationships with them outside of class\n, particularly with those who teach in the field you want to teach as well.\nMeet with professors during their office hours often. Consult them whenever you have questions about assignments, papers, projects, or your overall progress. Most importantly, don't be afraid to talk to them about your future goals!\nYou want to build a strong rapport with your professors, which is basically the same thing as networking.\nThis way, you'll not only get a clearer idea of what a professor does, but you'll also guarantee yourself stronger, more cogent\nletters of recommendation for graduate school\n.\nStep 9: Gain Research and/or Publication Experience\nThis isn't an absolute necessity for undergraduates, but it can certainly be helpful for your future.\nIf possible,\ntry to gain research experience through your classes or extracurricular projects\n. For instance, you could volunteer to assist a professor with research after class or get a part-time job or internship as a research assistant.\nIf neither option works,\nconsider submitting a senior thesis that involves a heavy amount of research\n. Best case scenario, all of your research will amount to a publication (or two!) with your name on it.\nThat being said,\ndon't fret too much\nabout getting something published as an undergraduate\n. Most students don't publish anything in college yet many go on to graduate school, some of whom become college professors. Rather, just look at this as a time to get used to the idea of researching and writing about the results of your research.\nStep 10: Take the GRE and Apply to Grad School\nIf you're hoping to attend graduate school immediately after college, you'll need to\nstart working on your application by the fall of your senior year\n.\nOne big part of your graduate school application will be\nGRE scores\n, which are required for many graduate programs.\nThe GRE is an expensive test\n, so it's best if you can get away with taking it just once (though there's no harm in taking it twice).\nAlthough the GRE isn't necessarily the most important feature of\nyour grad school application\n, you want to make sure you're dedicating enough time to it so that it's clear you're really ready for grad school.\nOther parts of your grad school application will likely include the following:\nUndergraduate transcripts\nPersonal statement\n/\nstatement of purpose\nCurriculum vitae (CV)\n/\nresume\nLetters of recommendation\nFor more tips on the GRE and applying to grad school, check out\nour GRE blog\n.\nPart 3: Graduate School (Master's Degree)\nOnce you've finished college, it's time to start thinking about graduate school. I'm breaking this part into\ntwo sections: master's degree and doctorate\n.\nNote that although some doctoral programs offer a master's degree along the way, others don't or prefer applicants who already have a master's degree in the field.\nStep 11: Continue to Keep Up Your Grades\nAgain, one of your highest priorities should be to keep up your grades so you can get into a great doctoral program once you finish your master's program. Even more important,\nmany graduate programs require students to get at least Bs in all their classes\n, or else they might get kicked out of the program! So definitely focus on your grades.\nStep 12: Become a TA\nOne great way to utilize your graduate program (besides taking classes!) is to become a Teaching Assistant, or TA, for an undergraduate class. As a TA, you will not only receive a wage but will also\ngain lots of firsthand experience as a teacher at the postsecondary level\n.\nMany TAs lead small discussion sections or labs entirely on their own, offering a convenient way to ease into college-level teaching.\nTAs' duties typically involve some or all of the following:\nGrading papers and assignments\nLeading small discussion or lab sections of a class (instead of its large lecture section)\nPerforming administrative tasks for the professor\nHolding office hours for students\nThe only big negative with being a TA is the time commitment\n; therefore, be sure you're ready and willing to dedicate yourself to this job without sacrificing your grades and academic pursuits.\nBecoming a TA can teach you a lot about ... teaching.\n(\nCenter for Teaching Vanderbilt University\n/Flickr)\nStep 13: Research Over the Summer\nMaster's programs in the US typically last around two years, giving you at least one summer during your program. As a result,\nI strongly recommend using this summer to conduct some research for your master's thesis\n. This way you can get a head start on your thesis and won't have to cram in all your research while also taking classes.\nWhat's more, using this time to research will\ngive you a brief taste of what your summers might look like as a professor\n, as college professors are often\nexpected to perform research over their summer breaks\n.\nMany graduate programs offer summer fellowships to graduate students who are hoping to study or conduct research (in or outside the US). My advice?\nApply for as many fellowships as possible\nso you can give yourself the best chance of getting enough money to support your academic plans.\nStep 14: Write a Master's Thesis\nEven if your program doesn't require a thesis, you'll definitely want to write one so\nyou can have proof that you're experienced with high-level research\n. This type of research could help your chances of getting into a doctoral program by emphasizing your commitment to the field you're studying. It will also provide you with tools and experiences that are necessary for doing well in a doctoral program and eventually writing a dissertation.\nStep 15: Apply to Doctoral Programs\nOR\nApply for Teaching Jobs\nThis step has two options depending on which path you'd rather take.\nIf you really want to teach at a four-year college or university, then\nyou must continue on toward a doctorate\n. The application requirements for doctoral programs are similar to those for\nmaster's programs\n. Read our guide for more information about\ngrad school application requirements\n.\nOn the other hand, if you've decided that you\ndon't\nwant to get a doctorate and would be happy to teach classes at a community college or technical school,\nit's time to apply for teaching jobs\n.\nTo start your job hunt, meet with some of your current or past professors who teach in the field in which you'll also be teaching and see whether they know of any job openings at nearby community colleges or technical schools. You might also be able to\nuse some professors as references for your job applications\n(just be sure to ask them\nbefore\nyou write down their names!).\nIf you can't meet with your professors or would rather look for jobs on your own, try browsing the career pages on college websites or looking up teaching jobs on the search engine\nHigherEdJobs\n.\nPart 4: Graduate School (Doctorate)\nThe final part of the process (for becoming a college professor at a four-year institution) is to\nget your doctoral degree in the field you wish to teach\n. Here's what you'll need to do during your doctoral program to ensure you have the best chance of becoming a college professor once you graduate.\nStep 16: Build Strong Relationships With Professors\nThis is the time to\nreally focus on building strong relationships with professors—not just with those whose classes you've taken but also with those who visit the campus\nto give talks, hold seminars, attend conferences, etc. This will give you a wider network of people you know who work in academia, which will (hopefully) make it a little easier for you to later land a job as a professor.\nMake sure to\nmaintain a particularly strong relationship with your doctoral advisor\n. After all, this is the professor with whom you'll work the most closely during your time as a doctoral student and candidate.\nBe open with your advisor\n: ask her for advice, meet with her often, and check that you're making satisfactory progress toward both your doctorate\nand\nyour career goals.\nStep 17: Work On Getting Your Research Published\nThis is also the time to start getting serious about publishing your research.\nRemember,\nit's a huge challenge to find a job as a full-time professor\n, especially if all you have is a PhD but no major publications. So be sure to focus on not only producing a great dissertation but also\ncontributing to essays and other research projects\n.\nAs\nan article in\nThe Conversation\nnotes,\n\"By far the best predictor of long-term publication success is your early publication record—in other words, the number of papers you've published by the time you receive your PhD. It really is first in, best dressed: those students who start publishing sooner usually have more papers by the time they finish their PhD than do those who start publishing later.\"\nI suggest\nasking your advisor for advice on how to work on getting some of your research published\nif you're not sure where to start.\nStep 18: Write a Groundbreaking Dissertation\nYou'll spend most of your doctoral program working on your dissertation—the culmination of your research. In order to eventually stand out from other job applicants, it's critical to\ncome up with a highly unique dissertation\n. Doing this indicates that you're driven to conduct innovative research and make new discoveries in your field of focus.\nYou might also consider eventually\nexpanding your dissertation into a full-length book\n.\nStep 19: Apply for Postdoc/Teaching Positions\nOnce you've obtained your doctorate, it's time to start applying for college-level teaching jobs!\nOne option you have is to\napply for\npostdoctoral (postdoc)\npositions\n. A postdoc is someone who has a doctorate and who temporarily engages in \"mentored scholarship and/or scholarly training.\" Postdocs are employed on a short-term basis at a college or university to help them gain further research and teaching experience.\nWhile you can theoretically skip the postdoc position and dive straight into applying for long-term teaching jobs, many professors have found that\ntheir postdoc work helped them build up their resumes/CVs before they went on to apply for full teaching positions at colleges\n.\nIn\nan article for\nThe Muse\n, Assistant Professor Johanna Greeson at Penn writes the following about her postdoc experience:\n\"Although I didn't want to do a post-doc, it bought me some time and allowed me to further build my CV and professional identity. I went on the market a second time following the first year of my two-year post-doc and was then in an even stronger position than the first time.\"\nOnce you've completed your postdoc position, you can start applying for full-time faculty jobs at colleges and universities. And what's great is that\nyou'll likely have a far stronger CV/resume than you had right out of your doctoral program\n.\nConclusion: How to Become a College Professor\nBecoming a college professor takes years of hard work, but it's certainly doable as long as you know what you'll need to do in order to prepare for the position and increase your chances of securing a job as a professor.\nOverall, it's extremely difficult to become a professor.
