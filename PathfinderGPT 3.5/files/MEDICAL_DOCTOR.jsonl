What Now?\nI Want to Be a Doctor! What Now?\nUndergraduate Medical Education\nDoctor of Medicine (M.D.)\nQuestions to ask yourself\nDo I enjoy serving others?\nDo I enjoy being a student and learning?\nDo I enjoy studying science?\nDo I enjoy solving problems?\nDo I enjoy working in leadership roles?\nDo I enjoy working in a team?\nAm I prepared to make short-term sacrifices to achieve long-term goals?\nWhat are the major steps to becoming a doctor?\nGraduate from high school with strong academics\nAttend and finish college –\n4 years\nEarn a bachelor’s degree\nComplete prerequisite courses for medical school\nTake the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT)\nApply to medical school\nAttend and finish medical school –\n4 years\nComplete a residency training program +/- fellowship training programs in your desired field –\n3-7 years\nComplete a fellowship in a subspecialty area\n1-3 years\nWhat are the residency/fellowship training programs?\nMedical school prepares you to be a physician and gives you comprehensive, general medicine experience. After medical school you will need to apply and match to a residency program in which you learn your chosen medical specialty such as Family Medicine, Pediatrics, OB/GYN, General Surgery, Pediatrics, and more. There are 154 specialties and subspecialties! During this time, you are still learning of course, but you are a paid employee of the institution training you. Residency comes first, and the length of the program varies with specialty; the shortest are 3 years and the longest are 7 years. After your residency training, you may choose to further sub-specialize by completing fellowships usually lasting 1-3 additional years. At a minimum, you must complete a residency training program to become “board-certified” in\nany\nfield of medicine.\nWhat courses should I take in High School?\nMedical schools\ndo not require\nany specific high school courses. However, high school is a very important time to start developing analytical, problem solving, and communication skills. You should challenge yourself by taking:\nAs many science and math classes as possible\nAny Advanced Placement classes available at your school\nA speech course\nA foreign language class (especially Spanish if you plan to stay in Texas)\nWhat major should I have in college?\nYou can choose\nany\nmajor! There is no specific major for which medical schools are looking. You should pick something that you are really interested in studying for four years, whether it is science-related or not. Keep in mind, however, that whatever major you choose, you will be responsible for completing the required prerequisite courses for medical school. It is not recommended that you major in a specific health profession training program such as Physical Therapy or Nursing; these are professional programs that prepare you for a specific profession other than being a doctor.\nWhat if I have advanced placement, international baccalaureate, or dual enrollment credit for medical school prerequisite courses?\nFirst, be mindful that many students who have taken such courses do not have enough credit in any one subject to meet\nall\nrequirements for medical school. You should be diligent in reviewing both your college degree plan and the required prerequisite courses for specific medical schools. If you do have credit for all required prerequisite courses in a particular subject prior to starting college, you should consider taking at least one additional course in that subject during college. Medical schools want to see how you can perform in these courses at the college level. Moreover, some students may feel they do not know the material very well, and may decide to retake some of the courses for which they have already received credit. This is up to you!\nWhen do I need to decide that I want to go to medical school?\nThere is no official upper age limit to applying to medical school. Most people apply during or shortly after college, but people in their 30s and even 40s do as well. The most important aspect of when to apply to medical school is making sure you are ready to do so. With that being said, if you want to start medical school in the fall after you graduate from college, you would need to submit your application during the summer after your junior year of college. To do so comfortably, you would probably need to decide that you definitely want to apply to medical school sometime during your sophomore year of college. By this point, you still have plenty of time to take the necessary prerequisite courses and prepare for the MCAT. It is very important that you get in touch whatever pre-med advising faculty exists at your college as soon as you think you might want to go to medical school so they can help get you on the right track.\nWhat can I do now to prepare for myself for medical school?\nDevelop good time management, study skills, work ethic, and attitude towards your education. You need to get very good grades in college if you want to go to medical school, and you need very good study skills to get good grades.\nLearn to set aside a certain amount of time each day to study, even if you do not have to do so now. Take notes in class and review your notes when you get home.\nPractice studying early, rather than waiting until the night before the test.\n“Shadow” a physician that you know i.e. ask to follow them around during their workday to see what the life of a doctor is actually like. Aside from a good academic record, demonstrating that you have some experience in a healthcare setting is one of the most important parts of a medical school application.\nVolunteer in a hospital, clinic, or other healthcare facilities.\nSet clear short- and long-term goals for yourself, and start figuring out how you can achieve them.\nUndergraduate Medical Education\nAdmissions\nOverview\nAdmissions at a Glance\nResidency Match Results\nTechnical Standards\nInterview Process\nWho Are We Looking For?\nPaying for School\nNew Student Checklist\nCOVID-19 Admissions Information\nOutreach\nOverview\nSpeaker Request for a Virtual Event\nI Want to Be a Doctor!
