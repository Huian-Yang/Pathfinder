Research each program’s focus, the success rate of graduates, and the support systems available for students.\nIt is essential to choose a program that aligns with your long-term career goals, interests, and personal values. Doing so will ensure that you are well-prepared for a successful career in psychology and that you can make a meaningful impact within your chosen field.\nComplete Supervised Experience\nPre-doctoral Internship\n: Before obtaining your doctoral degree, you will need to complete a pre-doctoral internship consisting\nof at least 1,900 hours\n. This internship must be accredited by the\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA)\nor meet the requirements set by\nthe Tennessee Board of Examiners in Psychology\n.

This process ensures that you meet the moral and ethical standards required to practice psychology in Tennessee.\nWhat are the Requirements for Psychology License Renewal in Tennessee?\nUpon obtaining your psychologist license in Tennessee, you must renew it biennially. This process can be completed via the\nonline platform\n.

The remaining 22 credits may come from any combination of Type I, II, or III programs.\nFurthermore, three hours of the compulsory 40 must focus on cultural diversity education, and another three hours must address state and national ethical and legal standards.\nHow Long Does It Take to Become a Psychologist in Tennessee?\nThe time it takes to become a psychologist in Tennessee varies depending on the educational path, training, and individual circumstances.

Most graduate programs require applicants to have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution as a minimum prerequisite.\nWhile it is preferred to have a bachelor’s degree in psychology, many programs accept students with degrees in related fields, such as sociology, human services, or neuroscience, provided they have completed some foundational psychology coursework.\nIn some cases, universities offer integrated or combined bachelor’s and master’s programs in psychology, allowing students to complete both degrees within a shorter time frame, typically around five years. These programs are designed for students who know early on in their undergraduate studies that they want to pursue a graduate degree in psychology.\nIf you have not yet earned a bachelor’s degree, your best course of action would be to enroll in an undergraduate program in psychology or a related field.
