 {"url":"you've decided you want to become a lawyer? Congratulations! Lawyers tend to be some of society's most prestigious and well-paid professionals. But we'll be frank: you've got a long road ahead of you that will require dedication, hard work, and (likely) a lot of coffee.\nFortunately, you're about to read this guide, which lays out everything you need to know about how to become a lawyer, from what to possibly major in during your undergraduate studies, and when you should take the LSAT, to how to prepare for the\nlaw school admissions requirements\n, and what to do after you pass the bar exam … and everything else in between.\nBy the time you finish reading, you'll understand exactly what you need to do to turn your dream of becoming a lawyer into reality. Let's begin!\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(click to skip ahead)\nHow to become a lawyer\nStep One: Earn a bachelor's degree\nStep Two: Take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) or Graduate Record Examination (GRE)\nStep Three: Apply to and complete law school\nStep Four: Pass the Bar Examination\nStep Five: Obtain Your License\nHow long does it take to become a lawyer?\nImportant skills for lawyers\nTypes of lawyers\nHow much does a lawyer earn?\nCan you be a lawyer without going to law school?\nFinal thoughts\nHow to become a lawyer\nEarn a bachelor’s degree\nTake the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) or Graduate Record Examination (GRE)\nApply to and complete law school\nPass the Bar Examination\nObtain Your License\nAnd here’s detail on how to complete each of those steps:\nStep One: Earn a bachelor's degree\nYou’ll need a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university to meet the application requirements at most law schools.\nWhy did we say “most law schools” instead of “all”? Well, there are some law schools that accept students without a bachelor’s degree.\nFor example, the\nGlendale University of College of Law\naccepts students with  “an AA or AS degree, or a minimum of 60 bachelor degree-applicable units from a regionally accredited college.”\nStill, without a bachelor’s degree, your options for law school would be limited, and you may miss the chance to develop some essential skills.\nWhat degree do you need to be a lawyer?\nYou may think you need to major in politics, history, economics, or some other field related to the legal profession during your undergraduate studies. But here’s the truth:\nlaw schools don’t care what you major in.\nWhat they do care about is your GPA and LSAT score.\nSo, pick an undergraduate major that interests you and that allows you to develop skills like critical thinking and logical argumentation—those will be important for both the LSAT and law school itself. That way, you can focus on learning and getting the best grades possible instead of trying to predict what might look good on your law school applications.\nStep Two: Take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) or Graduate Record Examination (GRE)\nThe next step in the process is to take either the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE).\nDepending on the law school you're applying to, some may require the LSAT as the only admission test, while others may accept the LSAT or GRE.\nFor example,\nHarvard Law School\naccepts applicants with LSAT or GRE scores. Their admissions website also states that they do not have a preference for either exam. On the other hand,\nEmory University School of Law\nrequires applicants to submit LSAT scores.\nWhen can you take the LSAT?\nHere are the official\nLSAT test dates and registration deadlines\nfor 2023 and 2024.\n2023 LSAT Test Dates\nDates\nRegistration Deadline\nJanuary 13-14\nDecember 1, 2022\nFebruary 10-11\nDecember 27, 2022\nApril 14-15\nMar 2, 2023\nJune 9-10\nApril 25, 2023\nAugust 11-12\nJune 29, 2023\nSeptember 8-9\nJuly 25, 2023\nOctober 13-14\nAugust 31, 2023\nNovember 10-11\nSeptember 28, 2023\n2024 LSAT Test Dates*\nDates\nRegistration Deadline\nJanuary 12-13\nNovember 30, 2023\nFebruary 9\nDecember 26, 2023\nApril 12\nFebruary 29, 2024\nJune 7-8\nApril 23, 2024\n*There will likely be more test dates for 2024. However, as of the publishing date of this article, the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) website only shows official\nLSAT dates\nup to June 2024.\nWhen can you take the GRE?\nYou can\nschedule to take the GRE in person\nat various times throughout the year, depending on the dates offered at your local test center. You also have the option to\ntake the GRE at home\n, whenever is convenient, seven days a week.\nHow many times can you take the LSAT or GRE?\nYou can take the LSAT\nup to seven times\nover your lifetime—up to three times in a single testing year and five times during a five-year period.\nYou can take the GRE\nonce every 21 days\n—up to five times within any one-year period.\nWhen should you take the LSAT or GRE for law school applications?\nYou should take either the LSAT or GRE at least six months before your law school application deadlines. That way, you have plenty of time to prepare and ensure you’re happy with your score before submitting your applications.\nIf you’re a college student hoping to go to law school immediately after graduating, you’ll generally want to take either of these exams during the spring of your junior year, the summer after your junior year, or the fall of your senior year.\nStep Three: Apply to and complete law school\nThe next step is applying to, gaining admission, and completing law school.\nLaw schools typically require applicants to submit the following application materials:\nTranscripts from all post-secondary education\nLSAT (or sometimes GRE) scores\n2 letters of recommendation\nA law school personal statement\nComplete application\nFor an in-depth guide to the law school application requirements,\ncheck out this article\n.\nWhen are law school applications due?\nLaw school application deadlines vary depending on the specific law schools and the admissions cycle you are applying for.\nMany law schools in the United States have rolling admissions, meaning they review applications as they are received and may have multiple deadlines throughout the year. In rolling admissions, applying as early as possible is generally advantageous, as seats and scholarship funds may become limited as the cycle progresses.\nHowever, there are two other common application cycles and deadlines you should be aware of:\nEarly Decision/Early Action:\nSome law schools offer an early decision or early action option, with deadlines usually falling between September and November. Early deadlines may offer advantages such as priority consideration or expedited decision timelines, but early decision applications are binding commitments.\nRegular Decision\n: The regular decision deadline for many law schools is usually between December and February. This is the main application deadline for most law school applicants. Unlike early decision applications, you can apply regular decision to multiple law schools.\nHow long does it take to complete law school?\nMost full-time law school students earn the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in three years. Part-time students may take up to five years to complete law school.\nWhat do you learn in law school?\nLaw school education provides students with a comprehensive understanding of legal principles, analytical skills, and the ability to think critically. The curriculum typically covers a broad range of subjects related to law and legal practice.\nHere are some of the key areas of study in law school:\nLegal foundations:\nLaw students start by learning the fundamentals of legal systems, including constitutional law, contracts, property law, civil procedure, and criminal law.\nLegal research and writing:\nStudents learn to research legal sources, such as statutes and case law, and develop strong writing skills to draft legal documents, memos, and briefs.\nLegal analysis and reasoning:\nLaw school teaches students to analyze complex legal issues, identify relevant legal principles, and apply them to specific factual scenarios.\nSpecialized legal areas:\nStudents have the opportunity to explore various specialized areas, such as corporate law, criminal law, family law, environmental law, intellectual property law, international law, and more.\nProfessional skills:\nLaw schools often offer courses and programs to develop practical skills necessary for legal practice, such as negotiation, trial advocacy, legal clinics, and legal ethics.\nElectives:\nLaw school elective courses cover various legal topics and can be taken in areas such as health law, human rights, entertainment law, tax law, or any other specialized area.\nExamples of official law school curriculums\nIf you’d like to see greater detail, check out the curricula below from some highly respected law schools:\nColumbia Law School Curriculum\nUniversity of Washington School of Law Curriculum\nUniversity of Virginia School of Law Curriculum\nStep Four: Pass the Bar Examination\nOnce you've graduated from law school, the next step is to pass the bar exam.\nWhat is the bar exam?\nThe bar exam is a multi-day test determining eligibility to practice law in a particular state. The exam consists of multiple-choice questions, essays, and performance tests that measure your  knowledge and understanding of the law.\nYou can choose to take the bar exam for the particular state where you plan to practice law. However, many jurisdictions also allow you to take the\nUniform Bar Examination\n(UBE), designed to assess the same level of competence regardless of which state you're taking it in.\nHow to study for the bar exam\nStudying for the bar exam can be an intensive process, so it's essential to create a plan and stick to it. You should start studying at least six months before the test date. During this time, you'll want to review course material from law school, familiarize yourself with recent updates in state and federal laws, and practice taking bar exam questions.\nYou may also want to consider taking a prep course or joining a study group with other people taking the bar exam. Additionally, you may want to use study aids such as flashcards, practice tests, and mock exams.\nHow many times can you take the bar exam?\nMost states don’t have a limit on how many times you can take the bar exam. For the states that do set limits, the maximum number of times you can take the bar exam range from 2-6 times. You can\ncheck the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) website\nto determine the specific requirements and limits for re-taking the exam in your jurisdiction.\nStep Five: Obtain Your License\nObtaining your law license is the final step in becoming a licensed attorney. While the specific process may vary from state to state, the general steps are as follows:\nResearch State Requirements\n: Familiarize yourself with the specific requirements set by the state's bar association. Understand the application process, fees, and required documentation.\nComplete the Application\n: Fill out the application, providing personal information, educational background, and employment history.\nSubmit Required Documents\n: Include supporting documents such as law school transcripts, bar exam certification, and certificates of good standing from other jurisdictions.\nPay Application Fee\n: Most states require an application fee to cover administrative costs.\nBackground Check and Character Evaluation\n: Undergo a thorough review, including a character and fitness evaluation, which may include a criminal background check and assessment of moral character.\nSwearing-In Ceremony\n: Upon approval, attend a formal swearing-in ceremony where you take an oath to uphold the law and fulfill your duties as an attorney.\nReceive Your License\n: After completing all steps and meeting the requirements, you'll receive your law license. This grants you the authority to practice law in a particular jurisdiction. You’ll also need to keep your license up to date and fulfill any renewal or continuing education obligations.\nHow long does it take to become a lawyer?\nThe time it takes to become a lawyer can vary depending on your situation. Generally, it takes\nabout seven to eight years\nfrom the time you begin college until you are licensed and admitted to practice law.\nImportant skills for lawyers\nWhile law school will provide you with the technical knowledge and skills necessary to practice law, certain qualities or \"soft skills\" can make you a better lawyer. These “soft skills” are things you can begin developing and strengthening during your undergrad years.\nHere are some crucial skills to cultivate as a lawyer:\nAnalytical and critical thinking\n: Lawyers must have strong analytical and critical thinking skills to dissect legal problems, identify relevant information, and arrive at logical conclusions.\nCommunication\n: Lawyers must possess excellent verbal and written communication skills to articulate their arguments clearly, negotiate, and interact with clients, colleagues, and judges.\nResearch skills\n: Lawyers must be able to conduct thorough legal research, navigate through statutes, regulations, and case law, and retrieve relevant information to support their arguments.\nProblem-solving\n: Lawyers must be able to analyze situations, identify potential solutions, and devise strategies to achieve favorable outcomes for their clients.\nAttention to detail\n: Lawyers must be attentive when reviewing contracts, agreements, and legal documents to ensure accuracy and identify potential pitfalls.\nTime management and organization\n: Lawyers should have strong time management and organizational skills to stay on top of their workload and manage their caseload effectively.\nTypes of lawyers\nExploring different areas of law can help you find your niche and determine which path aligns with your interests and skills. Here are some of the most common types of lawyers:\nCorporate Lawyers\nLawyers specializing in corporate law advise businesses and corporations on legal matters such as contracts, mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property, employment law, and compliance with regulations.\nCriminal Defense Lawyer\nA criminal defense lawyer represents individuals or organizations facing criminal charges. They advocate in court, build defense strategies, negotiate plea deals, and protect their clients' rights.\nFamily Lawyer\nFamily lawyers handle legal matters related to family and domestic relations, such as divorce, child custody, adoption, prenuptial agreements, and child support. They may also assist with matters like domestic violence, guardianship, and property division.\nPersonal Injury Lawyer\nA personal injury lawyer represents individuals who have been injured by someone else's negligence or wrongdoing. In the event of an accident or injury, they assist their clients in seeking compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages.\nIntellectual Property Lawyer\nIntellectual property lawyers specialize in matters related to patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. They help clients protect their intellectual property rights and assist with licensing agreements, infringement cases, and disputes.\nEmployment Lawyer\nEmployment lawyers represent both employees and employers in matters related to the workplace, such as employment contracts, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wage disputes, and labor law.\nImmigration Lawyer\nImmigration lawyers help individuals and businesses navigate complex immigration laws and represent them before immigration authorities in matters related to visas, green cards, citizenship, deportation, and asylum.\nEnvironmental Lawyer\nAn environmental lawyer represents individuals, organizations, or government agencies regarding environmental regulations, sustainability, land use, pollution, and natural resource protection.\nReal Estate Lawyer\nA real estate lawyer reviews contracts, conducts title searches, negotiates deals, and handles disputes relating to property transactions.\nCivil Rights Lawyer\nCivil rights lawyers advocate for those whose civil rights have been violated. They handle cases involving discrimination, constitutional rights, voting rights, and police misconduct.\nThese are just a few examples of the diverse areas of law practice. Many lawyers specialize further within these broad categories or work in unique practice areas.\nHow much does a lawyer earn?\nYour earning potential as a lawyer depends on where you practice, your specialization, and experience level. According to Indeed, the average base salary for a lawyer in the United States is\n$97,115 per year\n. The annual salaries for lawyers reported in Indeed’s database range from $52,722 to $178,888 per year.\nCan you be a lawyer without going to law school?\nYes, in some states, it is possible to become a lawyer without attending law school or receiving a law degree if you pass the bar exam and receive permission from the state’s Supreme Court. This route requires extensive study of the law and can be very difficult.\nWhere can you take the bar without going to law school?\nThe only states that allow non-graduates of law school to take the bar exam are California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. All other states require applicants to have completed their legal education before they can sit for the bar.\nYou can review the guidelines for taking the bar without going to law school in each of those states by clicking on the following links:\nCalifornia\nVermont\nVirginia\nWashington\nFinal thoughts\nBecoming a lawyer is not for the faint of heart. It requires a strong commitment to prepare for law school admissions, study diligently during law school, pass the bar exam, and then obtain a license to practice law. But if you are determined and passionate about pursuing a career in law, it can also be an enriching and fulfilling experience!\nIf you're looking for additional resources to help you learn how to become a lawyer, we recommend speaking with our graduate school admissions consultants.

I would encourage anyone in college who wants to become a lawyer to take reading and writing classes.  Careful reading, where you think about the details of what you are reading, is an extremely important skill for whatever field of law you go into.  Being a good writer is also very important, because whether you write briefs for court or contracts or letters to clients, good, clear writing is critical to success.  And being a good reader and writer will help you in law school, to prepare for the bar exam, and life in general.  I was a journalism minor and we focused on finding the most important facts of a matter and reporting them clearly.  So you might want to try a journalism class.

These subjects will equip you with a solid foundation in law and legal analysis. They're particularly useful for understanding the intricacies of legal studies, including case law and statutory law.\nNext, you might want to consider Business. This subject not only broadens your knowledge of legal studies but also provides a useful background in Economics. In fact, Economics itself is another subject that fits well with a Pre-Law curriculum.\nFinally, don't overlook IT or Computer Science. Having a background in these areas can really enhance your analytical skills, which are crucial in the field of law.\nSo, there you have it, Mya. These are just a few suggestions, but remember, the choice is ultimately yours. Good luck with your studies!\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nLogin to comment\n0\nSheel Bedi\n7\nAnswers\n0\nUpdated\nDec 05, 2023\n·\nTranslate\nSee original\n·\nShare\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nSheel’s Answer\nJust to put things into perspective, my journey to law school began with a major in English during my undergraduate studies.\nWhile there have been discussions about the advantages of various majors, it's crucial to understand that there's no \"perfect\" or \"best\" major for pre-law. This is quite different from medical school where specific courses or majors are required. Law school doesn't expect you to come in with any particular knowledge base.\nThe only exception I can think of is patent law, where careers often necessitate a background in science from your undergraduate studies. If you're considering practicing law internationally or wish to cater to a specific clientele, proficiency in foreign languages can be advantageous.\nApart from this, you should focus on enrolling in courses that provide a robust intellectual groundwork for law school. Choose classes that push you to think critically, analyze deeply, and write effectively - opt for challenging courses! These could be in diverse fields such as philosophy, economics, history, mathematics, or science.\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that some of the most vital skills for a successful law career are not learned within the four walls of a classroom. Traits like diligence, empathy, active listening, and the courage to advocate for your client are of utmost importance!\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nLogin to comment\n0\nVincent Martin\nAttorney/Owner\n4\nAnswers\nBloomington, Minnesota\n0\nUpdated\nDec 08, 2023\n·\nTranslate\nSee original\n·\nShare\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nVincent’s Answer\nA great first step in your career journey could be to offer your skills as a volunteer or intern at a nonprofit organization that supports or represents low-income defendants.

Chemistry and biology will be the core science courses. For math, algebra, calculus and statistics will be needed. Other classes to take will be English, social studies, and American history and government. The combination of these concentrations will enable you to focus and refine your analytical skills for research; complex problem solving; investigative and innovative critical thinking; attention to detail; etc.\nOther skills that will need to be built upon center around team building, team work and communication. In any work culture, collaboration among team members, staff and partner departments occur on a daily basis. As a Defense Attorney, communication is essential and critical when dealing with clients, legal staff, law enforcement, etc. A college course in public speaking, communications and English will help with one's communication and writing skills. While in high school, the debate team will provide the opportunity to sharpen communication skills which are backed with research and factual data and information.\nThe educational pathway to become a Defense Attorney will be between 7-8 years. 4 Years will be to earn a Bachelor Degree. Law school will be 2-3 years to earn a Juris Doctor Degree. Then, there is the bar exam to take, to pass and to be earned in the state where you plan to practice law.\nAccording to U.S. News & World Report, here is a link to the Best Colleges and Universities for Law school:\n- Stanford University\n- Yale University\n- University of Chicago\n- University of Pennsylvania (Carey)\n- Duke University\n- Harvard University\n- New York University\n- Columbia University\n- University of Virginia\n- Northwestern University (Pritzker)\n- University of California (Berkeley)\n- University of Michigan (Ann Arbor)\n- Cornell University\nhttps://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings\nWhen reviewing colleges and universities, it is best to check the following:\n- In-State vs Out of State Tuition\n- Internships\n- Scholarships\n- Career Placement upon graduation\n- Course work and offered classes\n- Post-Graduate Degrees - Master and Doctoral\nScholarship applications can start to be submitted during your Junior year and will continue throughout your Senior year in high school. It is best to ask your Academic Advisor/School Counselor on the timeline process as well. Scholarship applications will have specific deadlines and requirements to meet in order to be submitted for review and consideration.\nYou may want to start to compile your resume/portfolio since a majority of scholarship applications will require academic grade point average (GPA), academic accomplishments, school activities (clubs, sports, etc.), community involvement (volunteer, church, etc.), academic and personal recommendations, etc. There may be essay requirements on why you are a qualified candidate to receive the scholarship, what your future goals are academically and professionally and other questions centering around who you are, your beliefs, etc.\nHere are a couple of links for College Scholarships:\nhttps://www.mometrix.com/blog/scholarships-for-college/\nhttps://www.nchchonors.org/students/awards-scholarships/national-scholarships\nAlso, it will be best to check with the colleges and universities that you will be applying to. You can check with the School/Department of your desired major, the Campus Career Center and the Register's Office for additional information for college scholarships and grants and specific requirements for qualifications.\nBest wishes for your education and career path as a Defense Attorney!I have been an attorney since 2004, and I have seen many changes in the field. Law is one of those fields where change is constant, and career evolution is always a result of a lawyer reinventing their professional focus areas and skills. When so much changes in this industry, how can someone build a good foundation for a legal career?\nWell, some things are clear up front. A strong work ethic is at the core of the legal profession; to become a lawyer, you also need to commit to lifelong learning. That begins in college as you choose courses that can help you start building a future career.\nRelated:\nWhat Is Business Law – and Why Is It Important?\nIf You Want to Become a Lawyer, Work on Your Soft Skills\nThe three pillars that are the basis of legal training and the legal profession in general are legal knowledge, critical thinking skills, and effective communication. Sometimes called soft skills (or\ntransferable skills\n), critical thinking and communication are direct focuses in many undergraduate courses.\nCourses to be a lawyer should include these types of courses first. Undergraduate courses will not transfer to a law school themselves (although the\nAmerican Bar Association\nhas begun to consider some options), but the skills you develop may help you during the rest of your career.\nSince grades will matter, you need to choose courses you can work hard and succeed at. After that, choose courses that will help make attending law school easier. Some courses will give you exposure to legal terms and make your first year of law school a little easier (an important consideration since your grades in law school will also be very important).\nPre-law programs will give you undergraduate courses with a basic overview of business law, corporate law or tax law. Those courses will also give you the opportunity to read some legal documents. This knowledge isn't enough to pass the bar exam, certainly, but it can create an effective basis that will help improve your career as a law student.\nGeneral undergraduate courses can offer a myriad of different foundations to build on. Here are some examples to consider if you want to apply for law school.\n1. Political Science Courses\nThe overarching view political science courses can provide is, in my experience, an element most\nlaw schools\ndo not cover. Legal practice can be hyper-focused and a lawyer dealing with family law, real estate law, or health law might spend an entire legal career in a law firm doing the exact same thing in the same genre of legal writing without seeing the big picture of the legal system.\nA few political science courses will also provide a background knowledge of constitutional law, a field that law school students will meet in their second year of law school. A constitutional law course will introduce the students not only to the basics of the field, but also a taste of how the Constitution connects to criminal justice.\n2. Criminal Justice Courses\nCourses in\ncriminal law\nalso offer a big picture look at the legal system, illuminating the macro level of societal context that influences how the whole criminal justice system works. In law school, students will look at cases closely with a micro perspective, dealing with the details of each isolated issue. With a larger perspective, you can understand the pipeline that sends people to jail.\n3. Environmental Science Courses\nWill a science major be helpful when you seek a future legal career? It could.\nFor example, environmental law requires an understanding of scientific texts and an understanding of scientific terminology. Courses in environmental science could be extremely beneficial if you decide to become a lawyer who works in this branch of the law.\n4. Biology and Medical Courses\nFuture lawyers have much to gain from science education. Additionally, law school students now come from a more diversified background than they used to. These diverse education paths are an asset to the whole profession. Aspiring lawyers who want to practice medical tort law will be better at their jobs if they have a background in medicine and biology.\n5. Accounting Courses\nAttorneys have many opportunities to work in the business world, and an accounting foundation could be very helpful if you are working on cases where you need to understand complicated accounts. Tax law and business law would also have direct intersections with this field.\n6. Research-Heavy Courses\nMany general English, history, psychology, healthcare, and science courses will require research skills and research papers. During your bachelor's degree, seek out those courses and take the opportunity to sharpen your research skills.\nLegal research and legal writing skills are important for all legal professionals. Law students consistently need to demonstrate their research abilities.\n7. Writing and Communication Courses\nCommunication is one of the three most important pillars in the profession. Use your undergraduate degree years to get some extra training in oral and written communication. Law schools' curriculum will cover these skills specific to the field, but getting a head start is a good idea.\nWriting skills are not easy to develop, and law schools often have legal educators that focus on writing skills. Many attorneys work directly in legal writing roles. A strong foundation in writing will also help with your law school application and the coursework you fulfill as part of your juris doctor degree.\n8. Exam-Heavy Courses\nIf you want to become a lawyer, you have to excel at test-taking. The Law School Admission Test (LSAT®) is a famous example and a core part of the law school admissions process.\nI am not a big fan of standardized tests, personally, but the Law School Admission Council is not likely to move away from this tool to rank prospective law students. The LSAT does not necessarily give a good prediction of law school success. But if you want to become a lawyer and practice criminal law, corporate law, intellectual property law, or any other type of law, you need to achieve a good score.\nTo prepare for the LSAT and the other tests you will face in law school, choose exam-heavy courses during your undergraduate degree. It's counterintuitive, and many students purposefully avoid courses that involve extra tests, but gaining this practice could help you in more ways than one.\nA good LSAT score will give you more options for admission into law school. Different law schools vary not only by prestige but also by financial aid and tuition cost. The more law schools you can choose from, the better your chance of getting a package you can work with.\nIn this way, college courses that push you to gain test-taking skills can help you save on tuition funds. A law school that is less nationally known might be willing to give scholarships to students with stellar LSAT scores and a demonstrated ability to study well.\nEducational and Licensing Requirements to Become an Attorney\nTo practice law and to become a lawyer, you need a bachelor's degree. After this degree, you will need to pass the Law School Admission Test and graduate from a law school with a juris doctor degree. Then you can take the bar examination for the jurisdiction where you aim to practice law.\nLaw schools approved by the American Bar Association build their programs in a way that will maximize the number of jurisdictions where their graduates can take the bar exam. In many states, practicing law requires law students to take part in\nlegal clinics\nso prospective law students need to think where they want to practice law after graduation.\nSome states will allow aspiring lawyers to sit for the bar exam from a non-ABA law school. If you plan to practice law in one of those states, those law schools might be a good option. Students should research their state of interest.\nYour state's bar association will determine what specific credentials you need to have in order to sit for the bar exam.\nWill the Result of the Bar Exam Matter?\nThe bar exam is very different from the Law School Admission Test. The scores you need to pass the bar can change from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Law students who passed a unified bar exam might then \"pass\" in one state, but not another.\nBeyond that threshold, does it matter how well you do on the bar exam? Generally, no.\nA good friend of mine practices intellectual property law in an office next to me in New York City. He always tells me he has no recollection of the material he studied for the bar exam.\nIf you ask him about family law or environmental law, he will give you a blank face common to many legal professionals. Many attorneys know how to file legal documents from their own niche, and that is it. Ask them to write document for civil litigation or serve as legal counsel for a labor law issue, and they would have no idea where to begin.\nIn a nutshell, the bar exam covers a great deal of material you may not have to retain to practice law. The scores do not matter – just pass the bar examination.\nCan I Take Online Courses to Be a Lawyer?\nYes, there are institutions that will give a law degree for online students. But before you enroll, remember that the most effective law degree is from an American Bar Association-approved law school.\nThe ABA has approved some law schools for hybrid programs, and a graduate from those law programs will receive a juris doctor degree that will allow them to sit for the bar examination in multiple states. Make sure to verify this important detail before making a commitment to any law school, online or otherwise.\nBut you might still question if a degree from a hybrid law program will be respected by hiring law firms and the other entities you will encounter as an attorney. There is no easy answer here. While online courses have certainly become more commonplace in many professions, individuals make their own decision on what they respect.\nIt is also worth considering how you will perform in a hybrid program. Some students will excel in online courses while others will suffer.\nDecide If You Really Want to Attend Law School\nMany people who are interested in law first think, \"I'll become a lawyer,\" but there are many important roles in the legal profession.\nFor example, paralegals have a critical role in the legal space. Many law firms have legal assistants who fill important legal positions that do not require them to attend law school, have a law degree, or pass the bar exam.\nA paralegal can prepare property law documents for an attorney to review and sign. A law degree is not a requirement to find a satisfying legal career.\nThink long and hard before taking out student loans. There are no promises when it comes to your career. Even if a law school presents employment data, always take it with a grain of salt.\nYou need to decide if a law degree is really what you want. No one can promise you a high salary after you graduate, and student loan debt is nothing to overlook. If you want to become a licensed attorney, then law school is the path for you. If you want a good career in the legal profession, take time to consider your options other than obtaining a law degree.\nAbout the Author\nIlan Fuchs, Ph.D.\nDr. Ilan Fuchs is a scholar of international law and legal history.
