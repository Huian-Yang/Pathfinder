Congratulations! Lawyers tend to be some of society's most prestigious and well-paid professionals. But we'll be frank: you've got a long road ahead of you that will require dedication, hard work, and (likely) a lot of coffee.\nFortunately, you're about to read this guide, which lays out everything you need to know about how to become a lawyer, from what to possibly major in during your undergraduate studies, and when you should take the LSAT, to how to prepare for the\nlaw school admissions requirements\n, and what to do after you pass the bar exam … and everything else in between.\nBy the time you finish reading, you'll understand exactly what you need to do to turn your dream of becoming a lawyer into reality. Let's begin!\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(click to skip ahead)\nHow to become a lawyer\nStep One: Earn a bachelor's degree\nStep Two: Take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) or Graduate Record Examination (GRE)\nStep Three: Apply to and complete law school\nStep Four: Pass the Bar Examination\nStep Five: Obtain Your License\nHow long does it take to become a lawyer?\nImportant skills for lawyers\nTypes of lawyers\nHow much does a lawyer earn?\nCan you be a lawyer without going to law school?\nFinal thoughts\nHow to become a lawyer\nEarn a bachelor’s degree\nTake the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) or Graduate Record Examination (GRE)\nApply to and complete law school\nPass the Bar Examination\nObtain Your License\nAnd here’s detail on how to complete each of those steps:\nStep One: Earn a bachelor's degree\nYou’ll need a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university to meet the application requirements at most law schools.\nWhy did we say “most law schools” instead of “all”? Well, there are some law schools that accept students without a bachelor’s degree.\nFor example, the\nGlendale University of College of Law\naccepts students with  “an AA or AS degree, or a minimum of 60 bachelor degree-applicable units from a regionally accredited college.”\nStill, without a bachelor’s degree, your options for law school would be limited, and you may miss the chance to develop some essential skills.\nWhat degree do you need to be a lawyer?\nYou may think you need to major in politics, history, economics, or some other field related to the legal profession during your undergraduate studies. But here’s the truth:\nlaw schools don’t care what you major in.\nWhat they do care about is your GPA and LSAT score.\nSo, pick an undergraduate major that interests you and that allows you to develop skills like critical thinking and logical argumentation—those will be important for both the LSAT and law school itself. That way, you can focus on learning and getting the best grades possible instead of trying to predict what might look good on your law school applications.\nStep Two: Take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) or Graduate Record Examination (GRE)\nThe next step in the process is to take either the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE).\nDepending on the law school you're applying to, some may require the LSAT as the only admission test, while others may accept the LSAT or GRE.\nFor example,\nHarvard Law School\naccepts applicants with LSAT or GRE scores. Their admissions website also states that they do not have a preference for either exam. On the other hand,\nEmory University School of Law\nrequires applicants to submit LSAT scores.\nWhen can you take the LSAT?\nHere are the official\nLSAT test dates and registration deadlines\nfor 2023 and 2024.\n2023 LSAT Test Dates\nDates\nRegistration Deadline\nJanuary 13-14\nDecember 1, 2022\nFebruary 10-11\nDecember 27, 2022\nApril 14-15\nMar 2, 2023\nJune 9-10\nApril 25, 2023\nAugust 11-12\nJune 29, 2023\nSeptember 8-9\nJuly 25, 2023\nOctober 13-14\nAugust 31, 2023\nNovember 10-11\nSeptember 28, 2023\n2024 LSAT Test Dates*\nDates\nRegistration Deadline\nJanuary 12-13\nNovember 30, 2023\nFebruary 9\nDecember 26, 2023\nApril 12\nFebruary 29, 2024\nJune 7-8\nApril 23, 2024\n*There will likely be more test dates for 2024. However, as of the publishing date of this article, the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) website only shows official\nLSAT dates\nup to June 2024.\nWhen can you take the GRE?\nYou can\nschedule to take the GRE in person\nat various times throughout the year, depending on the dates offered at your local test center. You also have the option to\ntake the GRE at home\n, whenever is convenient, seven days a week.\nHow many times can you take the LSAT or GRE?\nYou can take the LSAT\nup to seven times\nover your lifetime—up to three times in a single testing year and five times during a five-year period.\nYou can take the GRE\nonce every 21 days\n—up to five times within any one-year period.\nWhen should you take the LSAT or GRE for law school applications?\nYou should take either the LSAT or GRE at least six months before your law school application deadlines. That way, you have plenty of time to prepare and ensure you’re happy with your score before submitting your applications.\nIf you’re a college student hoping to go to law school immediately after graduating, you’ll generally want to take either of these exams during the spring of your junior year, the summer after your junior year, or the fall of your senior year.\nStep Three: Apply to and complete law school\nThe next step is applying to, gaining admission, and completing law school.\nLaw schools typically require applicants to submit the following application materials:\nTranscripts from all post-secondary education\nLSAT (or sometimes GRE) scores\n2 letters of recommendation\nA law school personal statement\nComplete application\nFor an in-depth guide to the law school application requirements,\ncheck out this article\n.\nWhen are law school applications due?\nLaw school application deadlines vary depending on the specific law schools and the admissions cycle you are applying for.\nMany law schools in the United States have rolling admissions, meaning they review applications as they are received and may have multiple deadlines throughout the year. In rolling admissions, applying as early as possible is generally advantageous, as seats and scholarship funds may become limited as the cycle progresses.\nHowever, there are two other common application cycles and deadlines you should be aware of:\nEarly Decision/Early Action:\nSome law schools offer an early decision or early action option, with deadlines usually falling between September and November. Early deadlines may offer advantages such as priority consideration or expedited decision timelines, but early decision applications are binding commitments.\nRegular Decision\n: The regular decision deadline for many law schools is usually between December and February. This is the main application deadline for most law school applicants. Unlike early decision applications, you can apply regular decision to multiple law schools.\nHow long does it take to complete law school?\nMost full-time law school students earn the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in three years. Part-time students may take up to five years to complete law school.\nWhat do you learn in law school?\nLaw school education provides students with a comprehensive understanding of legal principles, analytical skills, and the ability to think critically. The curriculum typically covers a broad range of subjects related to law and legal practice.\nHere are some of the key areas of study in law school:\nLegal foundations:\nLaw students start by learning the fundamentals of legal systems, including constitutional law, contracts, property law, civil procedure, and criminal law.\nLegal research and writing:\nStudents learn to research legal sources, such as statutes and case law, and develop strong writing skills to draft legal documents, memos, and briefs.\nLegal analysis and reasoning:\nLaw school teaches students to analyze complex legal issues, identify relevant legal principles, and apply them to specific factual scenarios.\nSpecialized legal areas:\nStudents have the opportunity to explore various specialized areas, such as corporate law, criminal law, family law, environmental law, intellectual property law, international law, and more.\nProfessional skills:\nLaw schools often offer courses and programs to develop practical skills necessary for legal practice, such as negotiation, trial advocacy, legal clinics, and legal ethics.\nElectives:\nLaw school elective courses cover various legal topics and can be taken in areas such as health law, human rights, entertainment law, tax law, or any other specialized area.\nExamples of official law school curriculums\nIf you’d like to see greater detail, check out the curricula below from some highly respected law schools:\nColumbia Law School Curriculum\nUniversity of Washington School of Law Curriculum\nUniversity of Virginia School of Law Curriculum\nStep Four: Pass the Bar Examination\nOnce you've graduated from law school, the next step is to pass the bar exam.\nWhat is the bar exam?\nThe bar exam is a multi-day test determining eligibility to practice law in a particular state. The exam consists of multiple-choice questions, essays, and performance tests that measure your  knowledge and understanding of the law.\nYou can choose to take the bar exam for the particular state where you plan to practice law. However, many jurisdictions also allow you to take the\nUniform Bar Examination\n(UBE), designed to assess the same level of competence regardless of which state you're taking it in.\nHow to study for the bar exam\nStudying for the bar exam can be an intensive process, so it's essential to create a plan and stick to it. You should start studying at least six months before the test date. During this time, you'll want to review course material from law school, familiarize yourself with recent updates in state and federal laws, and practice taking bar exam questions.\nYou may also want to consider taking a prep course or joining a study group with other people taking the bar exam. Additionally, you may want to use study aids such as flashcards, practice tests, and mock exams.\nHow many times can you take the bar exam?\nMost states don’t have a limit on how many times you can take the bar exam. For the states that do set limits, the maximum number of times you can take the bar exam range from 2-6 times. You can\ncheck the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) website\nto determine the specific requirements and limits for re-taking the exam in your jurisdiction.\nStep Five: Obtain Your License\nObtaining your law license is the final step in becoming a licensed attorney. While the specific process may vary from state to state, the general steps are as follows:\nResearch State Requirements\n: Familiarize yourself with the specific requirements set by the state's bar association. Understand the application process, fees, and required documentation.\nComplete the Application\n: Fill out the application, providing personal information, educational background, and employment history.\nSubmit Required Documents\n: Include supporting documents such as law school transcripts, bar exam certification, and certificates of good standing from other jurisdictions.\nPay Application Fee\n: Most states require an application fee to cover administrative costs.\nBackground Check and Character Evaluation\n: Undergo a thorough review, including a character and fitness evaluation, which may include a criminal background check and assessment of moral character.\nSwearing-In Ceremony\n: Upon approval, attend a formal swearing-in ceremony where you take an oath to uphold the law and fulfill your duties as an attorney.\nReceive Your License\n: After completing all steps and meeting the requirements, you'll receive your law license. This grants you the authority to practice law in a particular jurisdiction. You’ll also need to keep your license up to date and fulfill any renewal or continuing education obligations.\nHow long does it take to become a lawyer?\nThe time it takes to become a lawyer can vary depending on your situation. Generally, it takes\nabout seven to eight years\nfrom the time you begin college until you are licensed and admitted to practice law.\nImportant skills for lawyers\nWhile law school will provide you with the technical knowledge and skills necessary to practice law, certain qualities or \"soft skills\" can make you a better lawyer. These “soft skills” are things you can begin developing and strengthening during your undergrad years.\nHere are some crucial skills to cultivate as a lawyer:\nAnalytical and critical thinking\n: Lawyers must have strong analytical and critical thinking skills to dissect legal problems, identify relevant information, and arrive at logical conclusions.\nCommunication\n: Lawyers must possess excellent verbal and written communication skills to articulate their arguments clearly, negotiate, and interact with clients, colleagues, and judges.\nResearch skills\n: Lawyers must be able to conduct thorough legal research, navigate through statutes, regulations, and case law, and retrieve relevant information to support their arguments.\nProblem-solving\n: Lawyers must be able to analyze situations, identify potential solutions, and devise strategies to achieve favorable outcomes for their clients.\nAttention to detail\n: Lawyers must be attentive when reviewing contracts, agreements, and legal documents to ensure accuracy and identify potential pitfalls.\nTime management and organization\n: Lawyers should have strong time management and organizational skills to stay on top of their workload and manage their caseload effectively.\nTypes of lawyers\nExploring different areas of law can help you find your niche and determine which path aligns with your interests and skills. Here are some of the most common types of lawyers:\nCorporate Lawyers\nLawyers specializing in corporate law advise businesses and corporations on legal matters such as contracts, mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property, employment law, and compliance with regulations.\nCriminal Defense Lawyer\nA criminal defense lawyer represents individuals or organizations facing criminal charges.

According to Indeed, the average base salary for a lawyer in the United States is\n$97,115 per year\n. The annual salaries for lawyers reported in Indeed’s database range from $52,722 to $178,888 per year.\nCan you be a lawyer without going to law school?\nYes, in some states, it is possible to become a lawyer without attending law school or receiving a law degree if you pass the bar exam and receive permission from the state’s Supreme Court. This route requires extensive study of the law and can be very difficult.\nWhere can you take the bar without going to law school?\nThe only states that allow non-graduates of law school to take the bar exam are California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.
