However, to be the best teacher possible, the job requires the right personality, temperament, and mindset. Before committing time and resources to obtaining a teaching degree and training, it’s important to determine if your personal and professional interests align with the teaching profession. Additionally, you’ll need to be fully aware of the educational and certification requirements necessary to become a teacher. To help with this important decision-making process, ask yourself the following questions.\nAre you patient?\nDo you have a passion for helping others?\nCan you think outside the box?\nAre you a conscientious and organized person?\nDo you have good communication skills?\nIf you answered “yes” to most of the questions above, a career in teaching is likely a good choice for you.\nPrograms that might interest you:\nSponsored\nPublicServiceDegrees.org is supported in part by advertisements.

By shadowing a teacher, you can witness the tasks and responsibilities involved in the profession firsthand. Depending on where you live, there may be a formal job shadowing program available that allows you to tag along with a teacher. Alternatively, there may be volunteer opportunities at local schools that provide the chance to watch teachers in action.\nHow Long Does It Take to Become a Teacher?\nThe amount of time required to become a teacher is influenced by three major factors: your education and professional experience, the subject you want to teach, and your state’s teaching certification requirements. However, as a general rule, becoming a teacher typically requires at least a bachelor’s degree and a teaching license. This means that you can anticipate spending four to five years in school and working towards certification.\nStudents who attend school full-time to earn a bachelor’s degree may be able to begin teaching soon after graduating if they have already started the certification process while still in school. However, other students may need to add about a year to the four-year degree program to complete the certification or licensing requirements. If a master’s degree is required, another two or so years may be added to the total time it will take to begin working as a teacher.\nStep 2\nAssess Your Teaching Interests\nBefore selecting a teaching program, it is important to identify your teaching preferences. This involves asking yourself why you want to become a teacher. By answering this question, you can determine your preferred grade level, subject matter, and whether there are any special students you would like to teach. Understanding this information not only shapes which teaching degree and training path to pursue, but also helps you determine the appropriate courses to take and organizations to join.\nStep 3\nExplore Teaching Degree Options\nOnce you have identified your professional goals and preferences for where you would like to work, you can make informed decisions regarding your education options. This involves identifying which degree to pursue and what concentration or major to focus on. Choosing the right program will not only help you achieve your goals, but also ensure that you are qualified to teach your preferred group of students. Making the wrong decision may not prevent you from becoming a teacher, but it could result in increased time or costs to achieve your desired teaching position. The following section goes into more detail about the different degree and specialization options available to you.\nBachelor’s Degree in Education & Teaching\nFor many, a bachelor’s degree in education, teaching, or a similar area will be the standard degree, at least with respect to teaching at primary and secondary levels. In most states, the bachelor’s degree is the basic minimum degree necessary to begin teaching.\nWhat students learn depends on their chosen program and major. However, a bachelor’s degree on its own may not be enough to become a licensed teacher. In addition to the degree, students must complete a teacher preparation program (TPP). Many schools offering education degrees combine the TPP into the bachelor’s degree curriculum. The TPP helps prepare future teachers to present learning materials to students from differing backgrounds and abilities. Discover\nbachelor’s degree programs in teaching online\n.\nMaster’s Degree in Education & Teaching\nWhile some teaching positions do require a master’s degree, it is not always a requirement. In cases where a master’s degree is required, teachers may have up to five years from the start of their job to earn the degree.\nDepending on the level and subject matter, the master’s degree can provide additional skills for improved teaching, open the door to potentially higher pay, allow the teaching of a different group of students, or open the avenue of advancement in education, such as in administration. Another reason to earn a master’s degree in education or teaching is to become a teacher in the first place. Many future teachers already have a bachelor’s degree, but not have completed their TPP. The master’s degree program provides this opportunity.

Unlike the EdD, which focuses on applying existing research, the PhD focuses more on developing new research and theory. The ultimate goal of a PhD program is to prepare graduates for leading roles in research, academia, and teaching at the post-secondary level. Much of the curriculum focuses on teaching skills that are useful for engaging in research that can create new knowledge and innovative theories that practicing teachers can use to improve education. Read more about\nonline PhDs in education & teaching\n.\nDoctor of Education (EdD) Degree\nThe Doctor of Education Degree is specifically designed for individuals who aspire to transition from teaching to administrative or policymaking roles. Unlike other teaching degrees, EdD’s main objective is to equip students with the skills to effectively apply research-based knowledge in real-world educational settings.\nWhen earning an EdD degree, students can focus their learning on research and education issues concerning policy and practice. The courses help prepare graduates for a career that requires a hands-on leadership role in not just educational systems, but professional organizations and government. See if an\nonline EdD program\nmight work for you.\nDegrees in Early Childhood Education\nAn early childhood education degree is an excellent choice for individuals seeking to teach at the preschool or kindergarten level. However, those pursuing this degree should anticipate concentrating on working with pre-kindergarten students primarily.\nThis degree is available in every path, from the associate all the way to the doctorate. The curriculum prepares you to help young children with their social and cognitive development, including motor skills and speech. Students graduate ready to help children who range in age from the earliest months to the seven or eight years old. Does an\nonline degree in early childhood education\nsound right for you?\nDegrees in Elementary Education\nCommonly available at the bachelor’s degree level, an online degree in elementary education is ideal if you wish to teach at the primary level. This includes teaching students from grades one through six, but may also mean teaching at the kindergarten or middle school levels, as well. During the course of study, elementary education students can expect to take courses that provide a wide range of subject matter material, from math to social studies to reading to art. On top of that, students learn about various teaching methods, strategies, and methods of student assessment. See if an\nonline degree in elementary education\nmakes sense.\nDegrees in Secondary Education\nIn the realm of education, secondary education is targeted towards students in middle and high school, typically ranging from 12 to 18 years old. Given that secondary education involves teaching older students, individuals pursuing a degree in this field should anticipate specializing in a particular subject area, such as English, mathematics, or science. Master’s programs in secondary education are typically tailored for students who already have a bachelor’s degree in the subject they wish to teach. For more, get the inside scoop on\nhybrid and online degrees in secondary education\n.\nDegrees in Physical Education\nPhysical education refers to improving, maintaining, and teaching physical fitness and well-being. Many degrees in physical education focus on teaching students from kindergarten through the end of high school. Those interested in teaching primary and secondary school students about staying healthy through sports and an active lifestyle should consider this degree. The curriculum should be similar to other teaching degrees, but also include coursework on physical fitness, learning motor skills, physical disabilities, and sports psychology. Learn about\nonline physical education degrees\n.\nDegrees in Special Education\nSpecial education is a popular subfield that involves helping students who need educational instruction that differs from the typical curriculum. Whether it’s a physical or mental disability, some students need not just extra attention or guidance, but particular teaching techniques that can require additional training and experience. That’s where these special education degrees come in; graduates learn how to identify students with special needs, craft a curriculum to meet those needs, deliver the academic material in a way the student can understand and learn, and provide additional social and behavioral teaching to students who need it. See\nonline special education degree\noptions.\nMore Education & Teaching Degrees by Subject\nIn addition to the above areas of educational focus, teachers can also decide to teach a particular academic subject, such as science, history, math, or English. Depending on the level of instruction, this can require special academic training. For example, at the high school or secondary level, many teachers must have majored in the area they would like to teach in. So if you want to teach US history, you must earn a bachelor’s degree in history. Other popular teaching concentrations include music, foreign language, theater, and art.\nStep 4\nDecide How You Want to Learn\nWith\nso many educational pathways for becoming a teacher, you have a\nnumber of ways to learn. The two major decisions you need to decide\non first are (1) pace of learning and (2) method of content delivery.\nCampus-Based vs. Online Teaching Programs\nOnline programs provide a significant advantage to working professionals, caregivers, busy parents, and anyone seeking flexibility. The convenience of online programs permits students to learn at their own pace, anytime, and anywhere. However, online degrees cannot yet completely replace traditional, campus-based teaching programs. Some online teaching programs require students to complete an in-person curriculum component. Additionally, there is an element of face-to-face interaction with classmates that is difficult to replicate in an online program. Furthermore, certain specialties or programs may only be available on-campus, depending on the institution.\nPart-time vs. Full-Time Teaching Programs\nOnline learning offers a significant advantage in terms of pacing, allowing students to progress through the curriculum at their own speed. Although full-time and part-time curriculums have always been options, distance learning provides greater flexibility. Full-time study allows students to earn their degree quickly, while part-time study enables individuals to devote extra time to challenging concepts or continue fulfilling work or caregiver responsibilities while attending school. The downside of a part-time program is that it typically takes longer to earn the degree.\nStep 5\nPick a Teaching Program & Apply\nOnce you decide which academic degree you want to earn, it’s time to find schools that offer it. There are plenty of great programs and reputable schools to choose from. The bad news is that so many choices can make it hard to find the right school for you. To help with this important step, we’ve created the following checklist.\nIs the school regionally accredited and by the NCATE?\nDoes it fulfill licensing requirements in the state you want to teach?\nDoes the program format work for my schedule?\nCan I realistically afford tuition and other costs?\nDo you have a realistic chance of getting accepted?\nPrerequisites and Applications\nBefore applying to your chosen school and program, you’ll need to look into what it takes to apply and get accepted. There are several components to the application, as well as prerequisites, which take time and advanced planning to handle.\nPrerequisites\nFor\nmany online teaching programs at the bachelor’s level, there aren’t\nmany prerequisites beyond what’s required for general admission.\nHowever, one key exception lies with state-specific skills testing.\nFor some states, this can be met with a certain score on an entrance\nexam test, like the SAT or ACT. But for other states, future teachers\nmust take the PRAXIS Core exam. And depending on the school, a\nstudent may need to take this before applying for admission.\nApplication\nApplying to a teaching program is very similar to applying to any other post-secondary program. Most applicants need to provide the following elements to complete their application for admission into a bachelor’s degree and teacher preparation program:\nApplication\nApplication fee\nEvidence of completion of a GED or a high school diploma\nHigh school transcript (if applicable)\nSAT or ACT entrance exam scores\nPersonal statement\nLetters of recommendation\nStep 6\nFund Your Teaching Degree\nIn addition to the time and effort it takes to become a teacher, there are usually significant tuition expenses, fees and other costs of attendance. For many, finding a way to pay for their college education is a significant hurdle. Luckily, there are several options available to help ease the financial burden. Some of these require repayment in the future while others are gift-based aid. To learn more about these school funding opportunities, please check out our\nFinancial Aid\nand\nScholarship\npages.\nStep 7\nFinish Your Coursework & Student-Teaching\nPredicting the coursework involved in earning an education degree can be challenging due to the varying state requirements for obtaining a teaching license, preferred teaching level, and academic pathways to becoming a licensed teacher. As a result, course offerings outside of the teaching preparation program curriculum can vary significantly, depending on the degree type, area of specialization (if applicable), and major.\nHowever, the core curriculum of a teaching program has a few similarities, such as covering topics relating to student development and teaching strategies. To get an idea of what kind of coursework you might encounter, check out the list of course examples.\nCourse Examples\n1\nDevelopment in Children\n2\nOral and Written Communication\n3\nIntroduction to Psychology\n4\nLearning and Inclusion\n5\nCurriculum Design\nStudent-Teaching\nFor students pursuing a teaching degree that encompasses a teacher preparation program, gaining practical teaching experience is crucial. This involves teaching students, typically in a public school setting, while being supervised by faculty, a classroom teacher, or a student-teaching office as appropriate. Before commencing the student-teaching segment of their curriculum, students must have progressed to an advanced stage of their program. This means they must:\nBe in their final year of the program.\nPass all necessary state-specific teaching exams, such as PRAXIS.\nHave a minimum GPA, either overall or for certain classes.\nHave approval from the appropriate program faculty member or administrator.\nBe a student in the teaching program for a minimum period of time.\nPass a criminal background check.\nPass a medical exam.\nOnce\naccepted, students may spend one or two school semesters engaged in\nstudent-teaching. And this isn’t just assisting a teacher in the\nclassroom, but actually teaching the class. During the experience,\nthe student teacher receives feedback and an evaluation to assess\ntheir teaching ability.\nStep 8\nGet Your Teaching License\nIn most cases, a teaching certification is required to teach at public schools, while private institutions may also prefer fully licensed teachers. Obtaining licensure is a straightforward process, but each state has its own set of requirements. Consequently, many aspiring teachers may not be certain which state they would like to teach in upon graduation.\nTo\ngive you a broad idea of what you can expect, let’s look at the\nmajor components of becoming licensed.\nLicensing in Your State\nEvery state has its own licensure requirements for teachers. Therefore, prospective teachers must check for specifics in their state. However, at a minimum, future teachers must do the following to become licensed:\nHave a bachelor’s degree.\nComplete an accredited teacher preparation program.\nPass a criminal background check.\nEarn sufficient scores on basic skills and/or subject matter exams, such as the Praxis Core, Praxis Subject Assessments or the Praxis Knowledge for Teaching Test.\nTo learn more about each state’s licensing requirements, please visit Education Commission of the States’\nTeacher License Reciprocity: State Profiles\npage, which has links to each state’s respective teaching licensure requirements.\nLicensing Reciprocity/Exchange\nReciprocity refers to a licensed teacher from one state being able to teach in another state. The goal of reciprocity is to facilitate the movement of teachers across state lines. While full reciprocity, where a licensed teacher from State A is automatically accepted by State B, is not common, an expedited or modified licensing process is often available. In such cases, State A may permit a teacher from State B to become licensed in State A following an abbreviated application process. This process varies depending on the teacher’s state of origin, level of education, and teaching experience. In several states, a new teacher may commence teaching almost immediately while completing the reciprocity requirements.\nTo\nlearn more about reciprocity, check out the following resources:\nEducation Commission of the States – 50-State Comparison: Teacher License Reciprocity\nTeach.com: Teacher Certification Reciprocity\nNoodle: Have Degree Will Travel. Teaching Reciprocity\nNational Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification: Interstate Agreement\nStep 9\nApply, Apply, Apply\nNow that you have your teaching degree, you need to find a place to put it to good use. You probably already have a grade level or subject matter you want to focus on, as well as a state you’d like to work in. But despite making those plans, there are still many other specifics to consider. For example, will you work in a public school or private? Urban or suburban? Second grade or third grade? These are just a few things to think about.\nTo finalize your decision on where you want to work, do your research. Online message boards are a good resource, but an even better one will be talking to your fellow classmates and current teachers and education administrators. Participate in networking events to get the inside scoop on where the nicer jobs are, who’s hiring and what school or district you’ll want to avoid.\nOnce you’ve selected the schools you’d like to teach in, it’s time to apply. Here are a few tips for the job search, interview, and selection process.\nFind good references. This will be one of the key components of your job application.\nWhen answering questions, whether in an interview or on an application, keep your answers school-oriented and emphasize what you can do for the students.\nLearn as much as you can about the school district and school you wish to work for. Don’t be caught surprised about a key detail about the job you apply to.\nDuring the interview, remember that you’ll need to fit in with not just the student body, but also the current teachers.\nNetwork like crazy. Just like any other profession, it’s not just what you know, but whom you know.\nConsider working as a substitute teacher at the school or district you want to join. It can provide an opportunity to make a great first impression when you apply for a permanent position.\nStep 10\nContinuing Education\nIn numerous states, licensed teachers are required to renew their teaching licenses every few years. As part of this renewal process, teachers must demonstrate that they have completed a certain number of continuing education or professional development credits. The precise type of continuing education and the number of credits required varies depending on each state’s teaching license renewal process.\nBut outside the requirements for maintaining licensure, continuing education is important to professional development. This not only allows teachers to be eligible for additional teaching or administrative positions, but can also provide networking opportunities. Below are five examples of continuing education programs or coursework that teachers can consider participating in.\n1. Another degree\nGetting a master’s or doctorate can provide opportunities to shift into non-teaching positions in education, as well as more specialized or advanced teaching jobs, working with more unique students or students at a higher level.\n2. Education workshop\nWhether hosted by government or private organizations, workshops provide opportunities for teachers to learn about new or emerging issues in education while connecting with other teachers and administrators.\n3. Education professional organization\nSome professional organizations designed for teaching professionals host or offer professional development opportunities. For example, the National Education Association has a special section of their website devoted to the\nprofessional development of Education Support Professionals\n.\n4. School district\nMany school districts provide pre-approved continuing education courses for teachers who must complete these credits for license renewal.\n5. Institutes of higher learning\nMany colleges and universities offer graduate coursework to meet not just continuing education requirements for license renewal, but also for salary advancement. Courses titles include 21\nst\nCentury Learning, Special Populations and Instructional Strategies.\nRelated Pages\nHow to Become a Licensed Social Worker Step-by-Step\nKathleen Curtis\n|\nApril 27, 2023\nHow to Become a Substitute Teacher\nShannon Lee\n|\nMay 29, 2024\nOnline Education & Teaching Degree Programs\nKathleen Curtis\n|\nJune 24, 2024\nLet’s keep in touch\nStay up-to-date with the latest education, training, and career trends.\nEnter your email\nCopyright © 2023.
