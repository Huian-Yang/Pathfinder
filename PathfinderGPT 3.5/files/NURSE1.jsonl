Certain states, such as New York, require RNs to hold a bachelor’s degree in nursing (BSN). Learn how to become a registered nurse with this step-by-step process.\n1\nComplete the Prerequisites for an ADN or a BSN\nWhether you choose an\nassociate degree in nursing\n(ADN) or a BSN degree, you must complete liberal arts, math, and science prerequisites. Common\nprerequisites for nursing school\ninclude basic anatomy, physiology, biology, psychology, and statistics. Nursing schools often require that incoming students earn a minimum C grade in these courses.\n2\nEarn a BSN or an ADN Degree\nYou can start your nursing career with an ADN or a BSN degree. A four-year\nBSN degree\noffers in-depth education and training in leadership, interpersonal communication, and clinical nursing. A two-year ADN program covers nursing fundamentals and offers the fastest track to becoming a registered nurse.\nIf you start your nursing career with an ADN, you can earn a BSN later with an\nRN-to-BSN program\n. If you have a bachelor’s degree in a non-nursing field, an accelerated BSN program lets you graduate in as little as one year.\n3\nPass the NCLEX\nYou can apply for licensure six weeks before graduating and then register for\nthe NCLEX-RN\n. This computerized test includes a minimum of 75 questions and tests your skills in four areas: safe and effective care environment, health promotion and maintenance, psychosocial integrity, and physiological integrity. You have up to six hours to finish the exam.\n4\nFind Employment\nNo matter your degree path, be proactive in your\nnursing career search\n. That could mean contacting your college network and gathering job resources before graduating. It is also important to make a good impression\nduring clinical rotations\nwith potential healthcare employers.\n5\nBecome Certified in Your Specialty\nIf you want greater recognition, more career opportunities, and higher salary potential, consider becoming certified in your\nnursing specialty\n. To qualify, you often need two or more years of full-time clinical RN experience in your specialty and a passing score on an exam.\nWhat Is a Registered Nurse?\nRegistered nurses\nprovide nursing care to patients across the lifespan.
