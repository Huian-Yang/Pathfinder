Add in all of the hard-to-understand medical terminology, and it’s no surprise if you’re feeling overwhelmed and even a little lost.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services.\nPolicy\nBut you don’t have to try to figure it out alone. Family medicine specialist\nNeha Vyas, MD\n, explains some of the most common types of doctors and what they do, including the kinds of conditions they treat.\nPrimary care providers\nFirst things first: A\nprimary care provider\n(PCP) is your go-to, your first point of contact. They’re the one you see for annual checkups and vaccines, the one you call when you have the flu and the one you talk to about medical concerns as they arise.\n“Your PCP is responsible for a range of services, including checkups, immunizations, health screenings and managing chronic conditions,” Dr. Vyas says. “They also play an important role in preventive care and focusing on your long-term health.”\nPCPs are there to:\nTreat sudden illnesses.\nCare for chronic conditions and manage complex combinations of conditions.\nPerform health screenings,\nannual physicals\nand\nwell-woman exams\n.\nAdminister vaccinations.\nEncourage preventive care and provide health and wellness education.\nRefer you to specialists when needed.\nA primary care team\nmay include these types of providers:\nInternists\n(or\ninternal medicine specialists\n) care for adults.\nFamily physicians\ncare for people of all ages and have training in pediatrics (kids), obstetrics and gynecology (women’s health) and geriatrics (older adults).\nPediatricians\nspecialize in caring for infants, children and teens.\nNurse practitioners\n(NPs) are registered nurses with a master’s degree in nursing.\nPhysician assistants\n(PAs) have a master’s degree (usually from a school of medicine) and work under a doctor’s supervision.\n“Your primary care provider works closely with anyone else involved in your care, and their office keeps records of your health throughout the years,” Dr. Vyas says, “so it’s important to find a PCP and cultivate a lasting relationship.”\nAllergists and immunologists\nWhether you have hay fever, a bout of hives or a life-threatening food allergy, allergists and immunologists are the doctors for the job.\nAllergies\nhappen when your body’s\nimmune system\noverreacts to something it sees as an invader (say, pollen, pet dander, shellfish or peanut butter). These doctors specialize in conditions related to allergies and your immune system.\n“They might use skin prick tests, blood tests or other tests to figure out what you’re allergic to,” Dr. Vyas explains. “From there, treatment depends on the severity and type of your allergy, like whether you have seasonal allergies, food allergies and so on.”\nIf you’ve been diagnosed with an allergy, you may see an allergist or immunologist for\nallergy shots\n. They can also prescribe medications, inhalers and other breathing treatments to help you manage your asthma, especially if it’s triggered by allergies.\nAnesthesiologist\nAnesthesia\nis a treatment that prevents you from feeling pain during medical procedures — and\nanesthesiologists\nare the doctors who administer it. They also monitor your health during your procedure and help manage your pain afterward.\n“There are different types of anesthesia,” Dr. Vyas notes. “Sometimes, anesthesia just numbs one area of your body, and other times, it’s administered to make you unconscious throughout a procedure.”\nThe type of anesthesia you need depends on the procedure you’re having and other factors, like your risk of complications. Anesthesiologists are trained to understand those complexities to make sure you’re receiving the best care possible.\nCardiologists\nIt’s always important to follow your heart — especially if it’s leading you to a\ncardiologist\n. These doctors specialize in conditions related to your\nheart\nand\ncardiovascular system\n, from minor abnormalities to life-threatening illnesses, including:\nHeart disease\n.\nHeart attack\n.\nIrregular heartbeat\n.\nBlood clots\n.\nValve disease\n.\nCardiologists perform various tests, including chest X-rays, cardiac CTs and MRIs, cardiac catheterizations, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, to make their diagnoses. They can also prescribe medications and perform corrective procedures.\n“Some also focus on\npreventive cardiology\n, helping you stay healthy so you don’t experience a cardiac event,” Dr. Vyas says. “They’ll assess your risk of cardiovascular disease and teach you to manage any existing conditions so they don’t worsen.”\nDermatologists\nWhen you think of dermatology, you may think primarily of pimples, but\ndermatologists\nhandle all that and then some. (And no, their job doesn’t always look like what you’ve seen on\nDr. Pimple Popper\n!)\nDermatologists specialize in conditions related to the skin, hair, and nails, including:\nAcne\n.\nEczema\n.\nHair loss\n.\nPsoriasis\n.\nSkin cancer\n.\n“If you’re diagnosed with skin cancer, dermatologists can provide treatments like excision and radiation,” Dr. Vyas says.\nAnd not all dermatologists have the same focus. Medical dermatologists focus on skin health, like the above conditions, while cosmetic dermatologists do procedures like\nBotox® injections\n, laser surgery, fillers and chemical peels.\nEmergency medicine specialists\nNo one wants to have to visit the emergency room, but if you do, you’ll be in the presence of skilled emergency medicine specialists who specialize in treating life-threatening medical conditions. They’re trained in:\nTrauma and wound care\n: If you’ve had a fall, a burn or some other accident, these doctors can order tests and figure out next steps in your care.\nCardiovascular emergencies\n: “ER doctors are trained to recognize and respond to heart attacks, stroke and cardiac arrest,” Dr. Vyas explains, “and they can perform lifesaving emergency procedures like defibrillation.”\nRespiratory issues\n: If you’re having trouble breathing, an emergency medicine specialist can treat you for issues like asthma, pneumonia and more.\nOverdoses\n: They’re trained to recognize drug overdoses and administer lifesaving treatments to reverse the effects of drugs and poisons.\nInfections\n: Some infectious diseases, like sepsis or meningitis, can be life-threatening if they’re not treated quickly.\nEndocrinologists\n“Your\nendocrine system\ncreates hormones that regulate nearly all of your bodily functions, including growth and development, metabolism, sexual function, reproduction and more,” Dr. Vyas explains.\nEndocrinologists\n, then, are doctors who specialize in hormonal (endocrine) disorders. They use blood tests, imaging and other methods to identify, treat and monitor conditions like:\nDiabetes\n.\nInfertility\nrelated to hormonal issues.\nMetabolic syndrome\n.\nThyroid disease\n, including over and underactive thyroid.\nOsteoporosis\n.\nOvarian cysts\n.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n.\nThyroid cancer\nand other endocrine cancers.\nAdvertisement\nHormones are related to so many bodily functions that endocrinologists work closely with other providers to make sure you’re getting comprehensive care.\nFamily medicine specialists\nLooking for a primary care provider who can see everyone in your family, no matter their age? That’s\nthe role of family medicine specialists\n, who care for everyone, from newborns to seniors.\nThey focus on treating common and complex diseases, in addition to promoting preventive health and wellness. “Family medicine specialists can treat your family throughout the lifecycle,” Dr. Vyas states. “They often see the same patients for years or even decades.”\nTo better understand what family medicine doctors do, head back to the start of this list and read the opening section on primary care providers.\nGastroenterologists\nWhen tummy troubles escalate to something more, it may be time to involve a\ngastroenterologist\n, sometimes called a gastrologist. “They specialize in conditions related to the esophagus, stomach, small bowel and colon,” Dr. Vyas says, “along with diseases of the pancreas, liver and gallbladder.”\nGastroenterologists diagnose and treat disorders like:\nCeliac disease\n.\nColon cancer\n.\nGallstones\n.\nGastroesophageal reflux (GERD)\n.\nInflammatory bowel disease\n, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n.\nLiver disease\n.\nNutrition concerns.\nPancreatitis\n.\nGastroenterologists use diagnostic tools and procedures like\nendoscopies\n,\ncolonoscopies\nand more. They also work closely with other healthcare providers like dietitians, surgeons and oncologists.\nGeriatricians\nAs you age, your body starts to change in all kinds of ways, and your medical needs may become multifaceted.\nGeriatricians\nare aging specialists, focused on how the passage of time affects your mind and body and what you need in order to stay healthy.\n“Geriatricians are doctors of internal or family medicine who have additional training in geriatrics, or the health and care of older adults,” explains Dr. Vyas. “They specialize in preventing, diagnosing and caring for health issues that develop as you age.”\nThat includes:\nPreserving your brain health.\nMaintaining your physical strength.\nManaging your medications.\nA geriatrician doesn’t replace a primary care provider, but works closely with them and with any other specialists you see, especially if you have multiple health issues or complex conditions.\nHematologists\nTo be any kind of healthcare provider, you have to get comfortable with the possibility of blood and bleeding. But that’s especially true for hematologists.\n“As blood disorder specialists, hematologists specialize in diagnosing, treating and managing conditions related to the blood, bone marrow and\nlymphatic system\n,” Dr. Vyas states. For example, they address:\nAnemia\n.\nBleeding disorders\n.\nBlood cancers\n(leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma).\nBlood clotting disorders\n.\nHematologists work closely with pathologists, oncologists, surgeons and others.\nHepatologists\nBe careful with the spelling of this one. The word “hepatologist” looks and sounds a lot like “herpetologist” — scientists who study reptiles and amphibians! But\nhepatology\nis a branch of gastroenterology concentrated on\nliver disease\nand conditions that affect your gallbladder, pancreas and\nbiliary tract\n.\n“Some physicians specialize in gastroenterology on the whole, while others have a narrower focus on just hepatology,” Dr. Vyas notes. You might see a hepatologist for:\nHepatitis\n.\nCirrhosis\n.\nFatty liver disease\n.\nLiver cancer\n.\nLiver failure\n.\nLiver-related kidney disease\n.\nHepatologists manage aspects related to liver transplants, and they help you manage your disease through medication, lifestyle changes and more.\nInfectious disease specialists\nWait, why aren’t these doctors -ologists of some sort?! The technical term is “infectiologist,” but it’s rarely used — so “infectious disease specialists” it is.\n“Typically, your primary care provider can treat you for common\ninfectious diseases\n, like if you have a mild case of the flu, strep throat or COVID-19,” Dr. Vyas says. “But if you’ve been hospitalized for a severe infectious illness, or if things escalate to become severe, infectious disease specialists may get involved.”\nYou might see an infectious disease specialist for:\nBone and joint infections\n.\nBacterial meningitis\n.\nBrain abscess\n.\nC. diff\n.\nE. coli\n.\nEndocarditis\n.\nFungal infections\n.\nHIV\n.\nSalmonella\n.\nSepsis\n.\nTuberculosis\n.\nUrinary tract infections\n(if they progress to a kidney infection).\nYou might also see an infectious disease specialist for a pre-travel consultation, for serious illness after you’ve traveled or for a fever of unknown origin.\nAdvertisement\nInternists\nDon’t be fooled by this word: Internists aren’t interns! These primary care providers are skilled, fully trained and licensed doctors who specialize in\ninternal medicine\n, hence the term “internist.”\n“Specialists focus on one part of the body, like your heart or your bones,” Dr. Vyas clarifies, “but internists are trained as generalists, focusing on both preventing and treating diseases that affect adults.”\nFor more information about what internists do, scroll back up to the top of this list and check out the first section on primary care providers.\nNephrologists\nIf you’re dealing with kidney issues,\nnephrologists\nare the specialists who can help. These doctors specialize in kidney-related conditions like:\nKidney stones\n.\nKidney infections\n.\nKidney disease\n, including\ncystic kidney disease\n.\nEnd-stage renal disease\n.\nKidney failure\n.\nNephrotic syndrome\n.\nUrinary tract infections\n.\nNephrologists also manage\ndialysis\nand\nkidney transplant care\n, though they don’t do surgery. “They provide ongoing care to help patients maintain their kidney function and manage their symptoms,” Dr. Vyas says, “and they work with other providers, like urologists, oncologists and dietitians, as needed.”\nNeurologists\nYour\nnervous system\nis your body’s command center, controlling everything you think, feel and do, so when something is off in your nervous system, it can impact your whole body.\nNeurologists\nspecialize in conditions that affect your brain, spinal cord and nerves, like:\nAlzheimer’s disease\nand other\ndementias\n.\nBrain injury\nand\nspinal cord injury\n.\nBrain tumors\n.\nCerebral palsy\n.\nConcussion\n.\nEpilepsy\n.\nMultiple sclerosis\n.\nParkinson’s disease\n.\nSleep disorders\n.\nStroke\n.\n“Brain conditions can impact your entire body, so your neurologist works closely with other healthcare providers,” Dr. Vyas explains. “Depending on your condition, this may include surgeons, oncologists, speech therapists, physical therapists and more.”\nObstetricians and gynecologists\nEver heard someone mention their Ob/Gyn or maybe just their OB? An OB is an obstetrician, who focuses on all things related to pregnancy and childbirth. A gynecologist specializes in the overall health of women and\npeople assigned female at birth\n.\n“Though these fields are different, they’re often lumped together into the umbrella category of ‘Ob/Gyn,’” Dr. Vyas notes.\nGynecologists\nprovide routine and preventive care, including:\nConducting breast exams and screenings for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nPerforming annual checkups called\nwell-woman exams\n.\nDiagnosing and treating conditions of the female reproductive system, including vaginal infections, endometriosis, period-related issues and cancer of the uterus, ovaries and cervix.\nBut not everyone who sees a gynecologist will need an obstetrician — only if you’re pregnant or trying to become pregnant.\nObstetricians\nspecialize in:\nConducting prenatal screenings and exams.\nMonitoring your pregnancy.\nEvaluating fetal development.\nTreating health conditions that affect you or the fetus.\nManaging labor and delivery.\nProviding postpartum care.\nOncologists\nWhen you’re\ncoping with a cancer diagnosis\n, you want to be assured that your health is in the hands of someone who knows how to help.\nOncologists\nspecialize not only in diagnosing cancer, but also in working with their patients to develop a personalized treatment plan and provide supportive care.\nThere are three primary types of oncologists:\nMedical oncologists\ntreat cancer using chemotherapy, targeted therapies and other systemic treatments.\nSurgical oncologists\nspecialize in the surgical treatment of cancer, which includes biopsies and tumor removal.\nRadiation oncologists\nuse radiation therapy to treat cancer.\nOncologists may have specialties, like gynecology, pediatrics or neurology, that narrow their focus. And given the many complexities of cancer, these doctors work closely with surgeons, radiologists, pathologists and others so they can provide you with comprehensive, compassionate cancer care.\n“This also means helping patients manage the symptoms of cancer and the side effects of treatment, like pain, nausea and fatigue,” Dr. Vyas adds, “in addition to physical and emotional challenges.”\nOphthalmologists\nI spy with my little eye …\nophthalmologists\n, also known as eye doctors, who specialize in diseases and disorders related to the eyes. You might go to the ophthalmologist for:\nEye exams\n.\nGlasses and contacts prescriptions.\nTreatment of conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes-related retinopathy and macular degeneration.\nEye surgery for conditions like those named above.\nNot clear on the difference between ophthalmologists and optometrists? Ophthalmologists are medical doctors, while\noptometrists\nhave a doctor of optometry (OD) degree and attend optometry school instead of medical school.\n“You may see an optometrist for your routine eye exams or for minor eye-related conditions like\npink eye\n,” Dr. Vyas says, “but they’ll likely refer you to an ophthalmologist for more severe eye problems.”\nOrthopedists\nIf sticks and stones break your bones, an\northopedist\nmay be involved in helping you heal. These specialists diagnose, treat and manage conditions related to your\nmusculoskeletal system\n, which includes bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles and nerves. That includes health issues like:\nBack pain\nand\nneck pain\n.\nBone fractures\n.\nConcussions\n.\nDislocated joints\n.\nScoliosis\nand other spinal conditions.\nSports injuries\n, including sprains and strains.\nAdvertisement\nOrthopedists can also perform\njoint replacement surgery\n(think hip or knee replacement) to treat joint damage caused by injuries and conditions like osteoarthrosis.\n“They work with other healthcare providers, including rheumatologists, physical therapists and occupational therapists, to develop specialized treatment plans to help patients recover from or manage their conditions,” Dr. Vyas says.\nOtolaryngologists (ENTs)\nYou may know\notolaryngologists\nby their more common name — ear, nose and throat specialists, or ENTs. That also gives you a sense of their areas of specialty.\n“Otolaryngologists treat a variety of diseases and disorders that affect the ear, nose and throat and related structures of the head and neck,” Dr. Vyas says. It’s a long list that includes:\nBalance disorders\n.\nDeviated septum\n.\nEar infections\n.\nFacial trauma\n.\nHead and neck cancers\n.\nHearing loss\n.\nSinus infections\n.\nSleep disorders\n.\nSwallowing disorders\n.\nTinnitus\n.\nTonsillitis\n.\nVoice disorders\n.\nIs there anything you’re surprised to see on this list? Many of these conditions are also within the purview of other types of healthcare providers, like neurologists,\naudiologists\n,\nspeech therapists\nand oncologists. Otolaryngologists work closely with them to provide you with comprehensive care.\nPathologists\nYou don’t usually speak directly to\npathologists\n, but they play a critical role in disease diagnosis and management behind the scenes.\n“When you have a blood test, tissue sample or other type of testing done, pathologists are the ones reading those results and using them to help diagnose and treat medical conditions,” Dr. Vyas says.\nPathologists, who often work in lab settings, don’t typically directly interact with patients, but they work very closely with radiologists, oncologists, hematologists, surgeons and others to make diagnoses and determine treatments.\nPediatricians\nPediatrics is the study of children’s health, and\npediatricians\nare doctors who focus on treating kids. “They specialize in caring for children from birth to young adulthood,” Dr. Vyas notes. “That includes infants, children, and teenagers — typically up to age 18.”\nHere are some things pediatricians do:\nProvide regular health exams, known as\nwell-checks\n.\nAdminister\nchildhood vaccines\n.\nDiagnose and treat illnesses, injuries and behavioral and emotional issues.\nMonitor children’s growth and development.\nProvide nutritional guidance.\nOffer mental health support.\nPediatricians also work closely with other healthcare providers to provide comprehensive care to kids with complex medical needs and chronic illnesses. Pediatricians can specialize in a specific type of medicine to treat children with complex conditions, such as pediatric cardiology and pediatric endocrinology.\nPhysiatrists\nEven if you’re not familiar with the term “physiatrist,” you’re probably familiar with some of the things they do. They’re also known as physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, or PM&R doctors.\n“Physiatrists help you manage the pain related to neurological and musculoskeletal conditions, whether they stem from an injury or another condition,” Dr. Vyas says. “In most cases, you don’t work with\njust\na physiatrist, but they consult with others, like primary care providers and neurologists, to restore your functionality.”\nYou might see a physiatrist for:\nSports injuries.\nComplex neurological conditions, including brain injuries and multiple sclerosis.\nChronic pain conditions, like fibromyalgia.\nMotor disorders, like cerebral palsy and Parkinson’s disease.\nPhysiatrists, who are medical doctors, are different from\nphysical therapists\n, who have a doctorate in physical therapy but aren’t medical doctors. Physiatrists can diagnose health conditions, prescribe medicine and perform procedures, which physical therapists can’t do — but your physiatrist may prescribe physical therapy as part of your treatment plan.\nPodiatrists\nThere are 26 bones, 33 joints and more than 100 muscles, tendons and ligaments in your foot and ankle, so when something goes wrong, you’re going to want to see someone who knows\nexactly\nwhat’s going on in there.\nPodiatrists are foot and ankle doctors who specialize in conditions like:\nSprains\nand\nfractures\n.\nAchilles tendinitis\n.\nArthritis of the foot and ankle\n.\nBunions\n.\nDiabetes-related foot conditions\n.\nFlatfoot\n.\nPlantar fasciitis\n.\n“Podiatrists often work with surgeons, wound care specialists and rehabilitation specialists to make sure you receive comprehensive care and that you heal well,” Dr. Vyas adds.\nPsychiatrists\n“Psyche” means mind or soul, which is what\npsychiatrists\nhelp treat and heal. These medical doctors are licensed to diagnose and treat mental health conditions through therapy and prescription medications.\nYou might see a psychiatrist for:\nAnxiety disorders\n.\nDepression\n.\nEating disorders\n.\nGender dysphoria\n.\nPersonality disorders\n.\nSchizophrenia\n.\nSubstance use disorder\n.\nAdvertisement\n“Psychiatrists aren’t the same as psychologists, though the two often work hand-in-hand with one another and with other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive assessments and compassionate treatment,” Dr. Vyas notes.\nPsychologists\nare clinical specialists who have a PhD, not a medical degree. They can’t prescribe medication, but they can provide diagnostic and testing services, along with various types of\npsychotherapy\n.\nPulmonologists\nBreathing is one of those things you may take for granted. You don’t think about your breath until you can’t catch it!\nPulmonologists\nspecialize in lung conditions and others that affect your\nrespiratory system\n, like:\nAsthma\n.\nBronchitis.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n.\nCOVID-19\n.\nCystic fibrosis\n.\nEmphysema\n.\nLung cancer\n.\nPulmonary hypertension\n.\nSleep apnea\n.\n“Pulmonologists use diagnostic tests like chest X-rays, breath tests, sleep studies and more to make their diagnoses and figure out the right course of treatment,” Dr. Vyas says. “Like all specialists, they work closely with other healthcare providers to ensure that you’re getting the whole-body care you need.”\nRadiologists\nNope, no radios here. Radiology involves imaging tests like X-rays, ultrasounds and MRIs — and\nradiologists\nare the doctors who specialize in these tests, including performing them and reading their results.\n“Diagnostic radiologists are the experts who interpret your imaging results, while interventional radiologists use imaging techniques to help guide medical procedures,” Dr. Vyas clarifies. “A third type of radiologists, called radiation oncologists, specialize in using radiation therapy as cancer treatment.”\nRheumatologists\nRheumatologists\nare commonly associated with treating arthritis, but they specialize in other conditions, too.\n“These physicians diagnose and treat autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions that affect the bones, muscles, joints and skin,” Dr. Vyas says. These conditions can sometimes impact other body systems and organs as well.\nConditions that rheumatologists treat include:\nComplex and/or inherited disorders like\nosteoporosis\n,\nlupus\n,\npsoriatic arthritis\nand\nscleroderma\n.\nJoint problems like\nankylosing spondylitis\n,\ngout\nand\nrheumatoid arthritis\n.\nTendon issues like\npatellar tendonitis\nand\ntennis elbow\n.\nMuscle conditions like\nmyopathies\nand\nrhabdomyolysis\n.\nRheumatologists work with other specialists to diagnose you and create an individualized treatment plan.\nSleep medicine specialists\nNo sleeping on the job, unless it’s your specialty — like it is for this category of doctors, who diagnose and treat disorders like:\nInsomnia\n.\nNarcolepsy\n.\nParasomnias\n.\nShift work sleep disorder\n.\nSleep apnea\n.\nSleep medicine specialists, or somnologists, may have a variety of backgrounds and specialties, like pediatrics, internal medicine, family medicine, neurology and others.\n“They often recommend a\nsleep study\nso they can make a diagnosis and figure out a course of treatment that will help you get good, high-quality sleep,” Dr. Vyas says.\nUrologists\nUrologists\nspecialize in conditions related to the urinary tract and the male reproductive system — but you don’t have to be male to see a urologist. After all, everyone has a urinary tract! You might see a urologist for:\nFrequent\nurinary tract infections\n(UTIs).\nKidney stones\n.\nProstate issues\n, including\nprostate cancer\n.\nIncontinence\n.\nErectile dysfunction\n(ED).\nMale infertility\n.\nTrying not to have any (or any more) kids? Urologists also perform\nvasectomies\n, a safe and effective form of male birth control that stops sperm from leaving your body.\nWhat about surgeons?\nThis is a giant category all its own, as various types of surgeons specialize in different parts of the body and different types of surgeries and procedures. Some of the other types of doctors mentioned throughout this list are also surgeons (for example, gynecologists and urologists), while other types of surgeons\njust\ndo surgery.\nGeneral surgeons\nperform a wide variety of procedures, including appendectomies, hernia repairs and gallbladder removals.\nCardiothoracic surgeons\nspecialize in conditions related to the heart and lungs, including transplants.\nNeurosurgeons\nperform surgery on the brain, spinal cord and nerves.\nOphthalmic surgeons\ntreat eye-related conditions like glaucoma and cataracts.\nOrthopaedic surgeons\ndo procedures related to bones, joints, ligaments, tendons and muscles.\nPlastic surgeons\ndo reconstructive procedures, like breast reconstruction after a mastectomy or facial reconstruction after an injury.\nTransplant surgeons\nperform procedures to replace diseased organs, such as the liver, heart or lung, with healthy ones.\nVascular surgeons\nperform surgeries related to the blood vessels, like to address blocked arteries and aneurysms.\nHow to know what type of doctor you need\nIf you think you may need a specialist but aren’t sure where to begin, start by asking a\nprimary care provider\n(PCP) — or if you’re trying to figure out something related to your child’s health, start with their\npediatrician\n.\nThe exception is in the case of emergencies, when you should go directly to the emergency department. And even then, you should still follow up with your primary care provider afterward.\n“Your primary care provider is there to be just that — your primary source for all things related to your health,” Dr. Vyas states. “The best place to start is with your PCP, who knows your health history and can either treat you themselves or refer you to specialists as needed.”\nLearn more about our\neditorial process\n.\nHealth Library\nThe Importance of Having a Primary Care Doctor\nOverview\nHealth Library\nThe Importance of Having a Primary Care Doctor\nOverview\nAdvertisement\nRelated Articles\nJanuary 18, 2024\n/\nWellness\nWhat Is Health Equity and Why Does It Matter?\nInequality hurts our health at a personal, community and global level\nFebruary 6, 2023\n/\nPrimary Care\nMD vs. DO: What’s the Difference?\nThey practice medicine similarly, but DOs have a focus on the mind, body, spirit connection\nDecember 7, 2020\n/\nPrimary Care\nHow the Pandemic Is Straining the Healthcare System – and What You Can Do to Help\nPrevention is key to making sure everyone in your community can get the care they need\nApril 2, 2020\n/\nInfectious Disease\nHow Coronavirus Affects Everyone’s Healthcare — Not Just Yours\nCurrent changes help & protect; despite frustration\nJuly 25, 2024\n/\nPrimary Care\nNose Breathing vs. Mouth Breathing: Which Is Better?\nBreathing through your nose is far better for you, but depending on your anatomy, that may not always be possible\nJuly 2, 2024\n/\nPrimary Care\nFireworks Safety: How You Can Prevent Injuries\nStay safe while celebrating by using legal fireworks, keeping a safe distance and disposing of them properly\nJune 4, 2024\n/\nPrimary Care\nSummer Sniffles: Winter Isn’t the Only Time You Can Catch a Cold\nEnteroviruses are often to blame for summer colds, leading to a runny nose, sore throat and digestive symptoms\nMay 30, 2024\n/\nPrimary Care\nWhy Are People Ticklish?\nThe tickling response may be more about protection than enjoyment\nTrending Topics\nDiabetes & Endocrinology\nHow To Increase Your Metabolism for Weight Loss\nFocus on your body’s metabolic set point by eating healthy foods, making exercise a part of your routine and reducing stress\nDiabetes & Endocrinology\n5 Ways Forever Chemicals (PFAS) May Affect Your Health\nPFAS chemicals may make life easier — but they aren’t always so easy on the human body\nSkin Care & Beauty\nCould Rice Water Be the Secret To Healthier Hair?\nWhile there’s little risk in trying this hair care treatment, there isn’t much science to back up the claims\nHealth Categories to Explore\nBrain & Nervous System\nChildren's Health\nExercise & Fitness\nHeart Health\nMen's Health\nMental Health\nNutrition\nOrthopaedics\nPrimary Care\nSkin Care & Beauty\nWellness\nWomen's Health\nOther Popular Categories\nAging Well\nAllergies\nCancer Care & Prevention\nChronic Pain\nCold, Flu & Respiratory Illnesses\nDiabetes & Endocrinology\nDigestive\nEar, Nose & Throat\nEye Care\nInfectious Disease\nLung\nOral Health\nParenting\nPregnancy & Childbirth\nRecipes\nRheumatology & Immunology\nSenior Health\nSex & Relationships\nSleep\nUrinary & Kidney Health\nWeight Loss\nAd\nRendered:\nSat Aug 03 2024 12:21:48 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nPinterest\nSnapchat\nCleveland Clinic\nHome\nAbout Cleveland Clinic\nCareers at Cleveland Clinic\nGiving\nOffice of Diversity & Inclusion\nCommunity Outreach\nResearch & Innovations\nHealth Library\nFree Health eNewsletters\nResources for Medical Professionals\nMedia Relations\nSite Information & Policies\nSend Us Feedback\nAbout this Website\nAdvertising Policy\nSocial Media Policy\nCopyright, Reprints & Licensing\nWebsite Terms of Use\nWebsite Privacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNon-Discrimination Notice\nResources\nMobile Apps\nPodcasts\n9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 |\n800.223.2273\n| ©\n2024\nCleveland Clinic.
