Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.\nGetty\nFor many people, carving out a path that leads to a successful legal career starts with choosing an undergraduate degree. There are many options available, and the type of law you plan to practice may come into play as you choose your undergraduate pre-law major.\nCertain majors are more popular among law school applicants than others, and schools consider both an applicant’s grades and the rigor of the coursework they pursue. As you plan your education and career, you should keep these factors in mind. However, it’s also important to choose a major that fits your strengths and interests. In this article, we discuss the 13 most common undergraduate majors for law school students.\nWhy You Can Trust Forbes Advisor Education\nForbes Advisor’s education editors are committed to producing unbiased rankings and informative articles covering online colleges, tech bootcamps and career paths.

Instead, the organization suggests that any student planning to\nbecome a lawyer\nselects an undergraduate major that interests and challenges them. The ABA encourages students to seek a course of study that builds competence in certain core areas—such as problem solving, oral communication, public service and collaboration—that can help them succeed in law school.\nIn particular, your undergraduate major should include coursework that develops your research, critical-reading and writing skills. It’s best to choose a major that provides a well-rounded education through a variety of courses. Your major should challenge you to learn more about the subjects you enjoy.\nBen Cooper, founder and CEO of law school admissions firm PreLawPro, advises, “When it comes to selecting a major, students should allow their interest and aptitude to drive their choice instead of choosing the major/s that they think will be the most impressive to a law school.”\nWhile\nlaw schools\ndo consider your major, they typically place more weight on your undergraduate GPA. A high undergraduate GPA can help demonstrate that you take your education seriously and can consistently maintain the level of effort and achievement needed to complete a Juris Doctor (J.D.) and become a successful lawyer. For this reason, you should choose a major in which you will excel.\nCooper offers the following insights: “Too often, students spend a lot of time worrying about whether they have selected the ‘right’ major. For example, many freshmen and their parents assume that any aspiring lawyer needs to pursue political science. This is a myth, and while the choice of major can help students develop skills that are necessary for success in law school, an applicant’s GPA is much more important than their choice of major and minor.”\nBest Undergraduate Majors for Law School\nAccording to the ABA, traditional majors for law school applicants include history, English, philosophy, political science, economics and business. All of these areas of study can help students develop mastery in the key areas the ABA suggests future law students cultivate. However, undergraduates have many other valid options for law school preparation, and the ABA encourages learners to follow any course of study that they feel passionate about.\nBelow we list 13 common undergraduate majors for students who apply to\nJ.D. programs\n.\nHistory\nCoursework for\nhistory majors\ncovers cultures and civilizations, specific eras, geography, American and international studies, research and analysis, and social justice. Majoring in history can provide you with a greater understanding of people from different cultures and backgrounds, which can be useful for attorneys who practice any type of law.\nEconomics\nBachelor’s in economics\ncoursework includes micro- and macroeconomics, market outcomes, fiscal and monetary policy and basic economic modeling. Majoring in economics is an excellent option for aspiring tax and corporate attorneys. Additionally, an econ major requires students to develop proficiency in logical reasoning, a key component of the Law School Admission Test (LSAT).\nEnglish\nCoursework for an English major covers literature, cultural studies, historical periods, creative writing and critical theory. Majoring in English can help students develop strong communication skills, which are essential for attorneys who decide to practice any type of law.\nPhilosophy\nCoursework for\nphilosophy majors\nmay include metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic, social and political philosophy, and history of philosophy. Majoring in philosophy can help students develop skills in communication, analytical and logical argumentation, and rhetoric, which are useful for any type of law practice.\nPolitical Science\nA\npolitical science bachelor’s degree\nexplores political theory, government systems and the judicial system, making this an excellent option for an undergraduate major. Majoring in political science can help you prepare to specialize in virtually any type of law. However, although a political science major is often associated with future lawyers, law schools do not necessarily prefer political science graduates.\nFinance\nCoursework for\nfinance majors\nmay include business economics, cost analysis, accounting, business law, ethics, statistics and management. Finance can be a great major for those who plan to work in tax law, corporate law or real estate law. As with economics and philosophy majors, an emphasis on quantitative reasoning can build skills that may serve students well when it comes to\ntaking the LSAT\n.\nArts and Humanities\nCoursework for arts and humanities majors varies according to specialization but may include languages, literature, music, art, logic, philosophy, theater, religion and social sciences. Arts and humanities programs provide broad knowledge for future attorneys to use in many types of law practices. Coursework for these degrees can also hone competence in communication, collaboration and critical thinking.\nCommunications\nCoursework for\ncommunications degrees\nmay include rhetoric, public speaking, journalism, writing, public relations and advertising. Majoring in communications helps students develop excellent speaking and writing skills, which are essential to any attorney both in and out of a courtroom setting.\nPsychology\nWhat can you do with a bachelor’s in psychology?\nWell, you can go to law school. Psychology coursework involves studying human behavior and mental health issues. Majoring in psychology can benefit those specializing in many types of law, since understanding how people think and behave is helpful in a variety of situations.\nSociology\nCoursework for\nsociology majors\nmay cover human behavior, race relations, social theory, statistics, research methodology, criminology, social policy, family structures and religion. Sociology majors develop skills that help them relate to people from all walks of life, so law students who intend to work in divorce and family law, immigration or public defense may especially benefit from this major.\nBusiness Administration\nCoursework for a\nbusiness administration bachelor’s degree\nmay include economics, marketing, business communication, entrepreneurship, human resources, accounting and organizational management. A business administration major may be helpful for those who intend to practice corporate law, patent or intellectual property law, tax law or real estate law.\nCriminal Justice\nCriminal justice bachelor’s degree\ncoursework includes forensics, human behavior, social policies, research and management. While this coursework may help law school applicants who plan to become defense attorneys, a criminal justice major may not offer the level of academic challenge that many top law schools look for.\nSTEM Majors\nLawyers in some fields of law, particularly patent law, can benefit from STEM-based degrees that relate to their chosen areas of practice. STEM fields offer many rigorous courses of study that can help students develop law school-ready skills and demonstrate their ability to succeed in a challenging academic environment.\nShould You Major in Pre-Law?\nA pre-law degree covers general education, an introduction to law and other coursework that helps learners build solid analytical and reasoning skills. This major introduces students to some of the concepts they will need to know later in law school.\nWhile pre-law may seem like the logical best option, that is not necessarily the case. In fact, this major might hinder you more than help you. A pre-law major provides an introduction to basic legal concepts, but it may not offer particularly challenging coursework. This could potentially make you a less competitive law school candidate than other students.\nYour major should be something you both enjoy and excel at. If pre-law checks those boxes for you, consider choosing it as a major. If not, however, select a major that will expand your knowledge and help you build your skills.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhen it comes to your undergraduate record, strong grades, challenging coursework and a passion for your subject typically matter more to law school admissions officers than the specific course of study you follow. A wide variety of majors can prepare you for success in law school and your future legal career—but remember to seek out coursework that hones the specific skills you’ll need.\nAs Cooper notes, “Applicants need to develop the skills we know they need to do well in a J.D. program, e.g., critical thinking, research, editing, written communication, etc.\nThe good news is that with some planning and working with their academic advisors, students can use almost any major as a means of preparing for law school.”\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Best Majors for Law School Admission\nWhat is the best pre-law major?\nIf you plan to pursue a legal career, but you’re unsure what to major in as an undergraduate, here’s some good news: Law schools accept students from nearly any major. That said, the best pre-law majors are those that develop the skills you’ll need to pass the LSAT, get into law school and ultimately practice law. The American Bar Association lists 10 key competency areas to focus on, including problem solving, critical reading, and writing and editing.\nIs a pre-law minor worth it?\nPossibly, depending on your major. Pre-law or legal studies coursework typically covers topics such as legal reasoning, criminal law, business law and American government. Many courses in this minor help develop the analytical and communication skills you’ll need in law school. If your major doesn’t address those competencies sufficiently, or you’re looking for more exposure to legal concepts, a pre-law minor can offer one way to meet your goals.\nDo law schools care about your major?\nTo a degree, yes, but not in the way many students imagine. Law schools do consider your undergraduate major as part of a holistic admissions process, but rather than looking for specific subjects, they tend to focus on whether you earned high grades, chose an academically rigorous major and pursued coursework that developed your skills in key areas like writing, critical reading and research.\nWas this article helpful?\nShare your feedback\nSend feedback to the editorial team\nRate this Article\n★\n★\n★\n★\n★\nPlease rate the article\nEmail\nPlease enter valid email address\nComments\nWe'd love to hear from you, please enter your comments.\nInvalid email address\nSubmit\nThis form is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nThank You for your feedback!\nSomething went wrong.
