I would encourage anyone in college who wants to become a lawyer to take reading and writing classes.  Careful reading, where you think about the details of what you are reading, is an extremely important skill for whatever field of law you go into.  Being a good writer is also very important, because whether you write briefs for court or contracts or letters to clients, good, clear writing is critical to success.  And being a good reader and writer will help you in law school, to prepare for the bar exam, and life in general.  I was a journalism minor and we focused on finding the most important facts of a matter and reporting them clearly.  So you might want to try a journalism class.  Good luck to you.\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nI appreciate this, thank you for the advice.\nDave\nJul 26\nTranslate\nSee original\nDelete Comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\nCancel\nDelete\nFlag Comment\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this comment?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Comment\nThank you, this is really helpful.\nDave\nJul 26\nTranslate\nSee original\nDelete Comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\nCancel\nDelete\nFlag Comment\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this comment?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Comment\nThank you, this is really helpful.\nDave\nJul 26\nTranslate\nSee original\nDelete Comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\nCancel\nDelete\nFlag Comment\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this comment?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Comment\nLogin to comment\n1\nBaljit Gill\ntutor\n28\nAnswers\nMilpitas, California\n0\nUpdated\nDec 02, 2023\n·\nTranslate\nSee original\n·\nShare\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nBaljit’s Answer\nHello Mya,\nThere's a wide variety of classes you might consider if you're pursuing a law major.\nTo start with, Pre-Law classes or Political Science could be an excellent choice. These subjects will equip you with a solid foundation in law and legal analysis. They're particularly useful for understanding the intricacies of legal studies, including case law and statutory law.\nNext, you might want to consider Business. This subject not only broadens your knowledge of legal studies but also provides a useful background in Economics. In fact, Economics itself is another subject that fits well with a Pre-Law curriculum.\nFinally, don't overlook IT or Computer Science. Having a background in these areas can really enhance your analytical skills, which are crucial in the field of law.\nSo, there you have it, Mya. These are just a few suggestions, but remember, the choice is ultimately yours. Good luck with your studies!\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nLogin to comment\n0\nSheel Bedi\n7\nAnswers\n0\nUpdated\nDec 05, 2023\n·\nTranslate\nSee original\n·\nShare\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nSheel’s Answer\nJust to put things into perspective, my journey to law school began with a major in English during my undergraduate studies.\nWhile there have been discussions about the advantages of various majors, it's crucial to understand that there's no \"perfect\" or \"best\" major for pre-law. This is quite different from medical school where specific courses or majors are required. Law school doesn't expect you to come in with any particular knowledge base.\nThe only exception I can think of is patent law, where careers often necessitate a background in science from your undergraduate studies. If you're considering practicing law internationally or wish to cater to a specific clientele, proficiency in foreign languages can be advantageous.\nApart from this, you should focus on enrolling in courses that provide a robust intellectual groundwork for law school. Choose classes that push you to think critically, analyze deeply, and write effectively - opt for challenging courses! These could be in diverse fields such as philosophy, economics, history, mathematics, or science.\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that some of the most vital skills for a successful law career are not learned within the four walls of a classroom. Traits like diligence, empathy, active listening, and the courage to advocate for your client are of utmost importance!\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nLogin to comment\n0\nVincent Martin\nAttorney/Owner\n4\nAnswers\nBloomington, Minnesota\n0\nUpdated\nDec 08, 2023\n·\nTranslate\nSee original\n·\nShare\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nVincent’s Answer\nA great first step in your career journey could be to offer your skills as a volunteer or intern at a nonprofit organization that supports or represents low-income defendants. This opportunity will provide you with a direct experience of how criminal defense practices function. You might find yourself completely drawn to it, or you might decide it's not for you. Either way, it's a valuable experience that will guide you on your path.\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nThank you for sharing your perspective.\nDave\nJul 26\nTranslate\nSee original\nDelete Comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\nCancel\nDelete\nFlag Comment\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this comment?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Comment\nLogin to comment\n0\nMichael Torio\nConsultant - Data Reporting & Analysis (HQ Finance)\n246\nAnswers\nAlpharetta, Georgia\n0\nUpdated\nDec 02, 2023\n·\nTranslate\nSee original\n·\nShare\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nMichael’s Answer\nHi Mya:\nWhile in high school, one will need to focus on science and math classes to prepare for a career in law. Chemistry and biology will be the core science courses. For math, algebra, calculus and statistics will be needed. Other classes to take will be English, social studies, and American history and government. The combination of these concentrations will enable you to focus and refine your analytical skills for research; complex problem solving; investigative and innovative critical thinking; attention to detail; etc.\nOther skills that will need to be built upon center around team building, team work and communication. In any work culture, collaboration among team members, staff and partner departments occur on a daily basis. As a Defense Attorney, communication is essential and critical when dealing with clients, legal staff, law enforcement, etc. A college course in public speaking, communications and English will help with one's communication and writing skills. While in high school, the debate team will provide the opportunity to sharpen communication skills which are backed with research and factual data and information.\nThe educational pathway to become a Defense Attorney will be between 7-8 years. 4 Years will be to earn a Bachelor Degree. Law school will be 2-3 years to earn a Juris Doctor Degree. Then, there is the bar exam to take, to pass and to be earned in the state where you plan to practice law.\nAccording to U.S. News & World Report, here is a link to the Best Colleges and Universities for Law school:\n- Stanford University\n- Yale University\n- University of Chicago\n- University of Pennsylvania (Carey)\n- Duke University\n- Harvard University\n- New York University\n- Columbia University\n- University of Virginia\n- Northwestern University (Pritzker)\n- University of California (Berkeley)\n- University of Michigan (Ann Arbor)\n- Cornell University\nhttps://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings\nWhen reviewing colleges and universities, it is best to check the following:\n- In-State vs Out of State Tuition\n- Internships\n- Scholarships\n- Career Placement upon graduation\n- Course work and offered classes\n- Post-Graduate Degrees - Master and Doctoral\nScholarship applications can start to be submitted during your Junior year and will continue throughout your Senior year in high school. It is best to ask your Academic Advisor/School Counselor on the timeline process as well. Scholarship applications will have specific deadlines and requirements to meet in order to be submitted for review and consideration.\nYou may want to start to compile your resume/portfolio since a majority of scholarship applications will require academic grade point average (GPA), academic accomplishments, school activities (clubs, sports, etc.), community involvement (volunteer, church, etc.), academic and personal recommendations, etc. There may be essay requirements on why you are a qualified candidate to receive the scholarship, what your future goals are academically and professionally and other questions centering around who you are, your beliefs, etc.\nHere are a couple of links for College Scholarships:\nhttps://www.mometrix.com/blog/scholarships-for-college/\nhttps://www.nchchonors.org/students/awards-scholarships/national-scholarships\nAlso, it will be best to check with the colleges and universities that you will be applying to. You can check with the School/Department of your desired major, the Campus Career Center and the Register's Office for additional information for college scholarships and grants and specific requirements for qualifications.\nBest wishes for your education and career path as a Defense Attorney!\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nThank you so much, Michael!\nDave\nJul 26\nTranslate\nSee original\nDelete Comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\nCancel\nDelete\nFlag Comment\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this comment?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Comment\nLogin to comment\n0\nRelated Questions\nWhat should students take away from law school?\nInterested in legal affairs, and wanted additional information! #law #lawyer #law-school #attorney #law-practice #law-school\nWhat is the hardest part about being a Lawyer?\nI would like to study law when I go to college.\nWhat are some good law schools in NYC?\n#attorney #law-practice #law-school #lawyer #law\nAbout Us\nMission\nOur Impact\nTeam\nHiring\nBlog\nPress\nContact Us\nOur AI Career Coach\nGet Involved\nFor Students\nFor Professionals\nFor Teachers\nDonate\nSkills-based Projects\nHost a Chapter\nBe an Ambassador\nPartnerships\nK-12 Schools\nNonprofits\nHigher Education\nEmployee Engagement\nSponsorships\nWorkforce Development Boards\nTrade Associations\nProfessional Associations\nConference Volunteering\nMore\nCareer Ready Resource Page\nData and Insights\nCommunity Guidelines\nDEI Guidelines\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nNon Discrimination Policy\n© Copyright 2024.
