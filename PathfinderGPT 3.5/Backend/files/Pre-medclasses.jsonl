These requirements can be met within the context of any major, so long as you plan ahead and choose appropriate electives.\nConversely, a Biology major does not in itself qualify you for medical school. It is true that a majority of our\nPre-Medical/Pre-Dental\nand\nPre-Vet\nstudents major in\nBiology\n,\nBiochemistry\n,\nBiomedical Sciences\n, or\nChemistry\n, but in recent years we have sent students to medical school with majors in Religion, Philosophy, English, and Sociology. In every case, however, they had taken the required courses for medical school and had demonstrated the ability to do well in challenging science courses, usually through a minor in Biology and/or Chemistry.\nOur new\nHealth Scholars Program\nis an excellent way to prepare for medical school regardless of your major, with all of the requirements and benefits that will help set you apart.  For top students,\nScience Honors\nwill also allow you to complete a research project at a major research institution.\nCourse Requirements for Medical School\nMost medical schools require the following courses:\nOne year of Biology with lab\nOne year of General Chemistry with lab\nOne year of Organic Chemistry with lab\nOne semester of Biochemistry\nOne year of Physics with lab\nOne year of English\nIt is always recommended that you check with each medical school to which you are applying because requirements can and do change.\nWe recommend that premedical students take Biology 305-306 (Human Physiology I & II) during their sophomore or junior year. You should also take additional upper level science courses, in order to demonstrate that you can succeed in medical school coursework. The following courses are good choices for premedical students:\nBIO 214 Organismal Diversity\nBIO 260 Preceptorship in Health or Veterinary Sciences\nBIO 311 General Microbiology\nBIO 312 Pathogenic Bacteriology and Immunology\nBIO 325 Vertebrate Anatomy and Embryology\nBIO 335 Genetics and Molecular Biology\nBIO 337 Cell Biology\nBIO 421 Developmental Biology\nCHE 307 Chemistry and Cancer\nCHE 327 Medicinal Chemistry\nCHE 341 Biochemistry\nThere are also appropriate electives offered through other departments, including Kinesiology & Health Sciences (KHS), Psychology, Philosophy, and Healthcare Administration.\nThe Dreaded MCAT Exam\nAll medical schools also require that you take the MCAT exam (Medical College Admissions Test). The MCAT is administered several times a year. You must take the MCAT no later than the summer following your junior year in order for your application to be considered in the fall of your senior year. This means you need to be prepared for the MCAT exam in three years, not four. As minimal preparation you should complete the required courses listed above, as well as the following courses: Human Physiology, Introductory Psychology, and Introductory Sociology.  This should be complete by end of your junior year.\n“Real-World” Experience\nTo be a viable candidate for medical school you must demonstrate that you have sufficient firsthand experience with medical practice to make an informed career decision, not just the academic ability to succeed in the medical school classroom. “Shadowing”, in which a pre-medical students observe and assists practicing doctors, is an absolutely essential part of preparing for medical school. We offer an organized shadowing experience via Biology 260 (Preceptorship in Health or Veterinary Sciences), but we also strongly recommend that you find other opportunities to obtain firsthand experience. Volunteer or paid work in a hospital, clinic, or other medical setting is an excellent way to gain experience. Other forms of community service are also very important in demonstrating your commitment to help others, even if the work is not specifically medical.\nA Suggested Curriculum\nThe following sequence of science courses will prepare you to take the MCAT and apply to medical school at the end of your junior year:\nFreshman\nFall:\nBIO 111- Biological Principles (with lab)\nCHE 111- General Chemistry (with lab)\nSpring:\nBIO 212- Cellular & Molecular Biology (with lab)\nCHE 112, 113- General Chemistry II (with lab)\nSophomore\nFall:\nCHE 201, 202- Organic Chemistry I (with lab)\nBIO 214- Organismal Diversity (with lab), or start the physiology or physics sequence\nSpring:\nCHE 309, 310- Organic Chemistry II (with lab)\nJunior\nFall:\nPHY 111- General Physics I (with lab)\nBIO 305- Human Physiology I (with lab)\nBio 260- Preceptorship in Health or Veterinary Sciences\nSpring:\nPHY 112- General Physics II (with lab)\nBIO 306- Human Physiology II (with lab)\nCHE 340 – Biochemistry (with lab)\nSenior\nAdditional upper-level courses in:\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\nPsychology\nKinesiology\nor other appropriate fields\nYou do not have to follow this schedule exactly, so long as you complete these courses by the end of junior year. However, you should plan ahead so that you are taking two laboratory courses per semester. For example, if you start the Chemistry sequence your sophomore year you might also take Physics sophomore year – otherwise you will be taking Organic Chemistry, Physics, and Physiology, all with labs, concurrently in your junior year. Of course, you will also have to take additional courses to meet the requirements for your major. Again, plan ahead so you don’t have too many lab courses in any one semester.\nMany students choose to wait one or more years between college and medical school to pursue other interests or to further prepare for medical school. If you want to do so you can spread the courses listed above over four years. Be aware, however, that if you take the MCAT in your senior year you will not be able to start medical school until one year after you graduate.\nPre-Med Curriculum with a Biology Major\nFor a Biology major you will need to: (1) complete the Biology core, including Genetics (2) take the Biology junior seminar course, (3) take a senior capstone course, and (4) take at least 13 hours of 300- or 400-level Biology courses while still meeting the requirements described above. The following plan of study is just one example of how you can meet these requirements and be prepared for the MCAT exam at the end of your junior year:\nFreshman\nFall:\nBIO 111- Biological Principles (with lab)\nCHE 111- General Chemistry I (with lab)\nSpring:\nBIO 212- Cellular and Molecular Biology (with lab)\nCHE 112,113- General Chemistry II (with lab)\nSophomore\nFall:\nCHE 201, 202- Organic Chemistry I (with lab)\nBIO 214- Organismal Diversity (with lab)\nSpring:\nCHE 309, 310- Organic Chemistry II (with lab)\nBIO 314- Ecology & Evolution (with lab)\nJunior\nFall:\nPHY 111- General Physics I (with lab)\nBIO 305- Human Physiology I (with lab)\nBIO 260- Preceptorship in Health or Veterinary Sciences\nBiology elective (300 or 400 level)\nBIO 402 – Junior seminar\nSpring:\nPhy 112- General Physics II (with lab)\nBIO 306- Human Physiology II (with lab)\nSenior:\nFall:\nSenior Capstone\nBIO 335- Genetics and Molecular Biology (with lab)\nSpring:\n2 Biology electives (300 or 400 level)\n400 East College Street, Georgetown, KY 40324\nPhone:\n502-863-8000\nSafety:\n502-863-8111\nFollow Georgetown\nFollow Admissions\nAbout\nAdmissions & Aid\nAcademics\nCampus Life\nSpiritual Life\nAthletics\nSupport\nAlumni\nEnsor LRC (Library)\nApply to Georgetown\nVisit Georgetown\nRequest Information\nGive to Georgetown\nBy clicking on the Georgetown College website pages, you are agreeing to the current terms and conditions of the\nPrivacy Policy and Terms of Service\n.\nRequest More Info\nchevron_right\nSelect which applies best to you\nSelect...\nProspective Student\nCurrent Student\nParent\nAlumni\nSignup for our mailing list\nSubscribe to our mailing list\n*\nindicates required\nEmail Address\n*\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nNews from the President\nWeekly President's Perspective\nEnewsletter\nAlumni Monthly ENewsletter\nMonthly ENewsletter\nEvents\nGC Events\nGiving\nSupport GC\nGC Magazine\nGC Magazine Biannual (Online)"}
