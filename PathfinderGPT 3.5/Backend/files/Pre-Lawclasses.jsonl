I would encourage anyone in college who wants to become a lawyer to take reading and writing classes.  Careful reading, where you think about the details of what you are reading, is an extremely important skill for whatever field of law you go into.  Being a good writer is also very important, because whether you write briefs for court or contracts or letters to clients, good, clear writing is critical to success.  And being a good reader and writer will help you in law school, to prepare for the bar exam, and life in general.  I was a journalism minor and we focused on finding the most important facts of a matter and reporting them clearly.  So you might want to try a journalism class.  Good luck to you.\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nI appreciate this, thank you for the advice.\nDave\nJul 26\nTranslate\nSee original\nDelete Comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\nCancel\nDelete\nFlag Comment\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this comment?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Comment\nThank you, this is really helpful.\nDave\nJul 26\nTranslate\nSee original\nDelete Comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\nCancel\nDelete\nFlag Comment\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this comment?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Comment\nThank you, this is really helpful.\nDave\nJul 26\nTranslate\nSee original\nDelete Comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\nCancel\nDelete\nFlag Comment\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this comment?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Comment\nLogin to comment\n1\nBaljit Gill\ntutor\n28\nAnswers\nMilpitas, California\n0\nUpdated\nDec 02, 2023\n·\nTranslate\nSee original\n·\nShare\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nBaljit’s Answer\nHello Mya,\nThere's a wide variety of classes you might consider if you're pursuing a law major.\nTo start with, Pre-Law classes or Political Science could be an excellent choice. These subjects will equip you with a solid foundation in law and legal analysis. They're particularly useful for understanding the intricacies of legal studies, including case law and statutory law.\nNext, you might want to consider Business. This subject not only broadens your knowledge of legal studies but also provides a useful background in Economics. In fact, Economics itself is another subject that fits well with a Pre-Law curriculum.\nFinally, don't overlook IT or Computer Science. Having a background in these areas can really enhance your analytical skills, which are crucial in the field of law.\nSo, there you have it, Mya. These are just a few suggestions, but remember, the choice is ultimately yours. Good luck with your studies!\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nLogin to comment\n0\nSheel Bedi\n7\nAnswers\n0\nUpdated\nDec 05, 2023\n·\nTranslate\nSee original\n·\nShare\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nSheel’s Answer\nJust to put things into perspective, my journey to law school began with a major in English during my undergraduate studies.\nWhile there have been discussions about the advantages of various majors, it's crucial to understand that there's no \"perfect\" or \"best\" major for pre-law. This is quite different from medical school where specific courses or majors are required. Law school doesn't expect you to come in with any particular knowledge base.\nThe only exception I can think of is patent law, where careers often necessitate a background in science from your undergraduate studies. If you're considering practicing law internationally or wish to cater to a specific clientele, proficiency in foreign languages can be advantageous.\nApart from this, you should focus on enrolling in courses that provide a robust intellectual groundwork for law school. Choose classes that push you to think critically, analyze deeply, and write effectively - opt for challenging courses! These could be in diverse fields such as philosophy, economics, history, mathematics, or science.\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that some of the most vital skills for a successful law career are not learned within the four walls of a classroom. Traits like diligence, empathy, active listening, and the courage to advocate for your client are of utmost importance!\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nLogin to comment\n0\nVincent Martin\nAttorney/Owner\n4\nAnswers\nBloomington, Minnesota\n0\nUpdated\nDec 08, 2023\n·\nTranslate\nSee original\n·\nShare\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nShare a link to this answer\nCopy link\nVincent’s Answer\nA great first step in your career journey could be to offer your skills as a volunteer or intern at a nonprofit organization that supports or represents low-income defendants.

Chemistry and biology will be the core science courses. For math, algebra, calculus and statistics will be needed. Other classes to take will be English, social studies, and American history and government. The combination of these concentrations will enable you to focus and refine your analytical skills for research; complex problem solving; investigative and innovative critical thinking; attention to detail; etc.\nOther skills that will need to be built upon center around team building, team work and communication. In any work culture, collaboration among team members, staff and partner departments occur on a daily basis. As a Defense Attorney, communication is essential and critical when dealing with clients, legal staff, law enforcement, etc. A college course in public speaking, communications and English will help with one's communication and writing skills. While in high school, the debate team will provide the opportunity to sharpen communication skills which are backed with research and factual data and information.\nThe educational pathway to become a Defense Attorney will be between 7-8 years. 4 Years will be to earn a Bachelor Degree. Law school will be 2-3 years to earn a Juris Doctor Degree. Then, there is the bar exam to take, to pass and to be earned in the state where you plan to practice law.\nAccording to U.S. News & World Report, here is a link to the Best Colleges and Universities for Law school:\n- Stanford University\n- Yale University\n- University of Chicago\n- University of Pennsylvania (Carey)\n- Duke University\n- Harvard University\n- New York University\n- Columbia University\n- University of Virginia\n- Northwestern University (Pritzker)\n- University of California (Berkeley)\n- University of Michigan (Ann Arbor)\n- Cornell University\nhttps://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings\nWhen reviewing colleges and universities, it is best to check the following:\n- In-State vs Out of State Tuition\n- Internships\n- Scholarships\n- Career Placement upon graduation\n- Course work and offered classes\n- Post-Graduate Degrees - Master and Doctoral\nScholarship applications can start to be submitted during your Junior year and will continue throughout your Senior year in high school. It is best to ask your Academic Advisor/School Counselor on the timeline process as well. Scholarship applications will have specific deadlines and requirements to meet in order to be submitted for review and consideration.\nYou may want to start to compile your resume/portfolio since a majority of scholarship applications will require academic grade point average (GPA), academic accomplishments, school activities (clubs, sports, etc.), community involvement (volunteer, church, etc.), academic and personal recommendations, etc. There may be essay requirements on why you are a qualified candidate to receive the scholarship, what your future goals are academically and professionally and other questions centering around who you are, your beliefs, etc.\nHere are a couple of links for College Scholarships:\nhttps://www.mometrix.com/blog/scholarships-for-college/\nhttps://www.nchchonors.org/students/awards-scholarships/national-scholarships\nAlso, it will be best to check with the colleges and universities that you will be applying to. You can check with the School/Department of your desired major, the Campus Career Center and the Register's Office for additional information for college scholarships and grants and specific requirements for qualifications.\nBest wishes for your education and career path as a Defense Attorney!\n!\nFlag for review\nDelete Answer\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this answer?\nCancel\nDelete\nConvert answer to comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to convert this answer to a comment?\nCancel\nAccept\nFlag Answer\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this answer?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Answer\nThank you so much, Michael!\nDave\nJul 26\nTranslate\nSee original\nDelete Comment\n×\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\nCancel\nDelete\nFlag Comment\n×\nThanks for your help keeping CareerVillage safe!\nAre you sure you want to flag this comment?\nAdd a reason:\nNo reason given.\nCancel\nFlag Comment\nLogin to comment\n0\nRelated Questions\nWhat should students take away from law school?\nInterested in legal affairs, and wanted additional information! #law #lawyer #law-school #attorney #law-practice #law-school\nWhat is the hardest part about being a Lawyer?\nI would like to study law when I go to college.\nWhat are some good law schools in NYC?\n#attorney #law-practice #law-school #lawyer #law\nAbout Us\nMission\nOur Impact\nTeam\nHiring\nBlog\nPress\nContact Us\nOur AI Career Coach\nGet Involved\nFor Students\nFor Professionals\nFor Teachers\nDonate\nSkills-based Projects\nHost a Chapter\nBe an Ambassador\nPartnerships\nK-12 Schools\nNonprofits\nHigher Education\nEmployee Engagement\nSponsorships\nWorkforce Development Boards\nTrade Associations\nProfessional Associations\nConference Volunteering\nMore\nCareer Ready Resource Page\nData and Insights\nCommunity Guidelines\nDEI Guidelines\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nNon Discrimination Policy\n© Copyright 2024.

Deel\n|  01/31/2024\nBecoming a lawyer is both a fulfilling journey that requires an educational background and a dedication to studying law for the lifetime of your career. The law is ever-evolving, and lawyers must perpetually build on their existing knowledge to address changes and shifts in the legal landscape.\nPrior Coursework and Foundational Studies\nWhat subjects do you need to become a lawyer? There are a number of foundational subjects that – taken at both the high school and undergraduate college levels – can assist with preparation for a successful journey through law school and for working in the law field.\nOne such subject is English. Strong communication skills are essential for lawyers, and English classes can help you develop proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking. Good oral and written communication skills are crucial for legal research, brief writing, and courtroom presentations by future lawyers.\nAnother potentially helpful subject is mathematics. Although not directly linked to legal studies in a formal sense, studying mathematics can definitely aid in the development of thinking and problem- solving abilities, and such skills are essential in the field of law.\nPhilosophy and ethics are a third useful area. Legal cases often involve ethical dilemmas, and courses in philosophy can equip you with critical thinking skills for navigating these issues and establishing a strong ethical foundation.\nA fourth area of potential value would be social sciences. Gaining knowledge in subjects such as psychology, sociology, or anthropology can provide insights into human behavior and societal dynamics that prove beneficial when interacting with clients and handling difficult legal matters.\nOn a related note, foreign language skills can also be critically helpful. If you have aspirations of providing legal services to clients from different cultural or linguistic backgrounds, learning one or more foreign languages can be advantageous. Also, attorneys working in the arena of international law will almost always need to know a foreign language in order to provide future legal work.\nOther Subjects Worth Studying\nIt's important to note that successful attorneys and legal scholars come from a variety of different backgrounds and educational paths. For example, I entered law school and became a lawyer with a prior background and education in hospitality management. Now, I use my legal skills to assist with cases related to hotels, restaurants, and other hospitality industry matters.\nI also had law school classmates who came from backgrounds in accounting, law enforcement, environmental policy, politics, and many other academic areas. So there isn’t really a “wrong” choice with respect to prior education before attending law school.\nBut by incorporating a diverse array of subjects into your journey toward becoming a lawyer, you can acquire a well-rounded education that enhances your ability to excel within the legal profession.\nThe Juris Doctorate Degree\nTo pursue a career in law, it is important – and, in most U.S. jurisdictions, necessary – to obtain a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. This type of degree is typically a three- to four-year graduate program that specializes in legal studies. A law degree is considered a professional terminal degree in the United States.\nI have previously hosted podcast episodes about\nhow law school is a transformative process for many students\n. During a typical law school program, you will delve into subjects related to all aspects of legal substance and procedure.\nTypical Law School Curriculum\nIn law school, most students in a bachelor's degree program will be exposed to a regimented curriculum that encompasses the foundational principles of legal knowledge that are necessary for lawyers to effectively practice law and competently represent their clients. For instance, students may study subjects such as law, contracts, torts, criminal law, property law, civil procedure, legal research and writing, evidence, and ethics and professional responsibility.\nConstitutional Law\nMost first-year law students will take classes in Constitutional law. In order to interpret and enforce the law effectively, it is essential that law students grasp the principles and intricacies of the Constitution.\nContracts\nAnother subject commonly studied by first-year law students is\ncontracts\n. Law students must acquire solid knowledge about the creation and enforcement of legal agreements, as this area is an important aspect of practicing law.\nTorts\nIn later law school years, students will typically study torts. The subject of torts and tort law helps prepare students to deal with civil wrongs and cases involving injuries to persons and property.\nCriminal Law\nBy contrast,\ncriminal law\nexplores the subjects that encompass crimes, their elements, and the various procedures followed in different cases to prosecute criminal offenses.\nProperty Law\nLaw students will also learn about property law. Addressing the rights and interests related to estates as well as personal property is the focus of this subject. It is essential for any licensed attorney working in real estate and other related fields.\nCivil Procedure\nCivil procedure can take up to two semesters to complete in most law schools. Courses in this subject study the rules and protocols involved in litigating cases within a civil court setting.\nLegal Research and Legal Writing\nLegal research and writing are also a typically required part of any academic program in law schools. Through these classes, students acquire skills in conducting research and crafting persuasive legal documents like briefs and memoranda for litigation.\nEvidence\nLaw schools usually offer classes on evidence, where law students study the rules governing evidence presentation in court. These skills are particularly essential for trial lawyers in building successful cases.\nEthics and Professional Responsibility\nAlong with the traditional legal curriculum, law students must also study ethics and professional responsibility. Through these subjects, students gain an understanding of the codes and regulations that lawyers must adhere to, including ethical obligations incumbent upon legal professionals.\nKnowledge of ethics and professional responsibility is particularly important. Most modern state bar exams include a component specifically aimed at testing knowledge of ethics and professional responsibility.\nElective Classes in Law Schools\nFinally, as with most college degree programs, there is usually an elective requirement for study. With an array of optional classes to choose from, students can customize their learning experience by selecting courses aligned with their interests and career aspirations.\nTypical elective subjects that help students to better understand the legal system include:\nAdministrative law\nFamily law\nEnvironmental law\nIntellectual property\nLabor law\nCorporate law\nCriminal justice\nTax law\nInternational law\nIntellectual property law\nExtracurricular Activities\nIn addition to the actual classroom curriculum of a typical law school program, participating in activities like debate clubs, mock trial teams, and other extracurricular pursuits can be helpful. These extracurricular activities involve both public speaking and critical thinking, and they can offer serious advantages for students honing their skill. These kinds of activities enable the development of skills and abilities that are critical to the legal profession, such as the art of argumentation and persuasion.\nSpecialty Law Degrees\nIn addition to the traditional J.D. programs that most lawyers pursue, there are also a number of other specialty paths and degrees that scholars may choose in order to address the specific aims of their career ambitions.\nLLM\nOne such degree option is called a Master of Laws (LL.M.). An L.L.M. degree is typically pursued by lawyers who wish to specialize in an area of law, such as taxation, international law, or intellectual property.\nSJD or JSD\nA second specialty degree is called a Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D. or J.S.D.). This doctoral degree path is focused on research, and it caters to individuals interested in pursuing a scholarly career within the field of law.\nCombined Degree Programs\nLastly, there are also a number of combined juris doctor degree programs through which students can earn both a J.D. and another professional or academic degree through a joint program offering. These programs typically allow students to simultaneously earn a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree along with a master's degree, such as a J.D./M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration) or a J.D./M.P.A. (Master of Public Administration). There are even J.D./M.D. programs for students who may have an interest in medicine.\nHow Long Does It Take to Become a Lawyer?\nThe amount of time it takes to become a lawyer can vary based on a number of factors, such as your location, your educational path, and your personal circumstances. However, in the United States (and other westernized countries), the general timeline to become a lawyer follows a certain pattern.\nUndergraduate Degree\nThe first step is obviously the completion of an undergraduate degree (i.e., a bachelor’s degree at minimum). This degree usually takes around four years to complete. Although there is no specific major explicitly required for law school, most law students come from fields such as political science, history, English, or other related disciplines during their undergraduate years.\nIt's important to maintain a solid academic performance while you're taking classes for your undergraduate degree, since your grades at the undergraduate level can influence your chances of getting into law school.\nLaw School Admission Test\nThe next step – usually completed while finishing the final year or so of your undergraduate degree studies – is to take the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and earn a decent score. A good LSAT score can help improve your odds of being admitted to different law schools (and particularly higher-tier schools) by the law school admission council.\nThe LSAT is essentially a logic, critical thinking, and problem-solving test – and it contains many components similar to traditional IQ tests and high school Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SATs). The scores on the LSAT can range between 120 and 180.\nThe current average score across law school admissions is 159\n, according to Best Colleges.\nApplying to Law School\nUpon completing your bachelor's degree and taking the LSAT, you will need to apply to law schools and select a school. When choosing a law school, it is critically important to find a school that is accredited by the American Bar Association; most state bar exams require that applicants earn their degree from an ABA-accredited law school.\nCompleting Law School\nOnce you choose a school, you will need to attend law school for around three to four years on a full- or part-time basis in order to obtain the Juris Doctor (J.D.) law degree. As previously discussed, many law schools provide education and training through various courses covering key aspects of law as well as legal research and writing skills development. Additionally, you may have opportunities for internships and practical experiences that can really help to hone your skills before you seek to become a lawyer.\nPassing the Bar Exam\nOnce you finish your studies in law school, the next step towards becoming a lawyer is to prepare for and successfully take the bar exam in your jurisdiction. The amount of time it takes for students to prepare for the bar exam can vary from person to person and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Many aspiring lawyers dedicate months to intensive studying, and the pass rates for most bar exams are not terribly high.\nBar exams are extremely challenging – usually consisting of both multiple choice (quantitative) and essay (qualitative) components. They commonly take one or more days to complete, and the process to pass the bar exam is exhausting.\nIn my own career, I have taken and passed two state bar exams (Florida and Nevada) – and these exams were by far the most daunting academic undertakings of my professional student career. I studied for months on end prior to each exam, and I credit those efforts to my ability to pass both exams. Simply put, not studying (or studying poorly) for bar exams is not an option for those who want to enter the legal field and work in a law firm.\nAssuming you pass the bar exam, you will be eligible to obtain a license as an attorney and practice law within your chosen jurisdiction.\nReciprocity\nIf your state’s own bar examination has reciprocity with other states and jurisdictions, you may be able to petition for admission to those other state bars as well.\nFor example, in the Midwest region of the United States, many states utilize what is called the Multistate Bar Exam (MBE). This exam is a standardized bar exam for state application. Consequently, a law student who passes the MBE in one state can apply for admission to practice law in any other state that utilizes the MBE as well.\nBut it’s important to note that not all states share such reciprocity. For example, the state bar for Florida does not have reciprocity with any other states, so students who pass the Florida state bar exam are only eligible to practice law in Florida. To practice anywhere else, they must take separate bar exams.\nThe Entire Process\nThe entire journey of attaining a law degree and becoming a lawyer in the United States typically takes around seven years after completing high school. This figure includes the four years of undergraduate education, three years of law school, and several months dedicated to preparing for the bar exam. But it's important to keep in mind that some individuals may take longer due to pursuits of specialized degrees like a Master of Laws (LL.M.) or Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.), which can further extend the timeline.\nAlso, if students do not take a full-time course load throughout their academic careers at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, this type of course load can delay the completion of the process as well. Some students might choose to enroll in law school on a part-time basis or during evening hours.\nThe ABA limits the number of hours that full-time law students are permitted to work during their law school studies, so the part-time option may be attractive to some students because it allows them to balance their legal education with other obligations such as work. This option is exactly what I did when I was in law school, but law students should be aware that it may also prolong the duration of their studies.\nIt's worth noting that, internationally, each country has its own requirements and timelines for becoming a lawyer, and students should prepare accordingly. The process can be very different from one country to the next, depending on education and licensure requirements.
