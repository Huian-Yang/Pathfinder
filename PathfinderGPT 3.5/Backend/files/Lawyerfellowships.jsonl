We combine targeted litigation, legal advice, community education, advocacy, and organizing to secure people’s access to fundamental resources and services, including a high-quality education, health care, housing and community services, employment, a healthy neighborhood and the unencumbered right to vote. We accomplish our mission in partnership with a robust network of pro bono partners, community partners, volunteers and other essential stakeholders. PILC strongly values equity, inclusion, achieving racial and social justice, and empowering client communities through our high impact work.\nWe occasionally seek applications for candidates for post-graduate public interest fellowships to be sponsored by the Law Center.\nThe Law Center is not currently accepting fellowship applications.
